<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>And</span> will the Thunder Bird really lay
its egg upon the moon? Such a hard egg,
too! Will it&#8211;really&#8211;drop a pound
weight of steel upon the head of the Man
in the Moon?... Oh! de-ar Mammy
Moon&#8211;what a shock she&#8217;ll get.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl, the fifteen-year-old Camp Fire
Girl&#8211;all but sixteen now&#8211;to whom
Mammy Moon had been the fairy foster-mother
of her childhood, ever since she
lay, wakeful, in her little cot, looking up
at that silvery face of a burnt-out satellite,
picturing it the gate of Heaven and her
mother&#8217;s spirit as bathed in the soft, lunar
radiance behind it, caught her breath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
with a wild little gasp whose triumph was
a sob upon the still laboratory air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lay its egg in a nest of the moon! A
dead nest! It will do more than that,
little Pem!&#8221; Toandoah, the inventor,
turned from fitting a number of tiny sky-rockets
into the supply chamber of a larger
one,&#8211;turned with that living coal of fire
in his eye which only the inventor can know,
and looked upon his daughter. &#8220;Yes, it
will do more than that! The Thunder
Bird will lay its golden egg for us&#8211;if it
drops its expiring one upon the moon.
It will send us back the first record from
space, the very first information as to what
it may be that lies up&#8211;away up&#8211;a
couple of hundred miles, or so, above us,
in the outer edges of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere
of which less is known at present than of
the deepest soundings of the ocean. Our
Thunder Bird will be the&#8211;first&#8211;explorer.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>The man&#8217;s eyes were dim now. For a
moment he saw as in a prism the work of
his fingers, those little explosive rockets&#8211;the
charges of smokeless powder&#8211;which
being discharged automatically in flight,
would send the Thunder Bird upon its
magic way, roaring its challenge to the
world to listen, switching its rose-red tail
of light.</p>

<p>Then&#8211;then as the mist cleared those
deep, glowing eyes of his became to his
daughter a magic lantern by which she saw
a series of pictures thrown upon the sheeting
whitewash of the laboratory wall,
culminating in one which was almost too
dazzling for mortal girl of fifteen&#8211;though
born of a great inventor&#8211;to bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think,&#8221; she cried, rising upon
tiptoe, swaying there in the February sunlight,
&#8220;just to think that it&#8217;s a Camp Fire
Girl&#8211;a Camp Fire Girl of America&#8211;with
the eyes of the world upon her, who
will push the button, throw the switch
upon a mountain-top, launch the Thunder
Bird upon its glor-i-ous way, send off&#8211;send
off the first earth-valentine to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
Mammy Moon!... Oh! Toandoah&#8211;oh!
Daddy-man&#8211;it&#8217;s too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pemrose Lorry clasped her hands. Her
blue-star eyes, blue at the moment as
the tiny blossoms of the meadow star-grass
for which some fairy has captured
a sky-beam, were suddenly wet.</p>

<p>A slim, girlish figure in forest green&#8211;last
sylvan word in Camp Fire uniforms
which she was trying on&#8211;she
hung there, poised upon an inner pinnacle,
while sunbeams racing down
the whitewash did obeisance before her,
while spectroscope, lathe and delicate
balances, brilliant reflectors, offered
her a brazen crown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;well, it&#8217;s coming to you,
Pem&#8211;you sprite.&#8221; Her father shot
a sidelong glance at the nixie green as
he fitted another little rocket into its
groove in the larger one&#8217;s interior,
where the touch of a mechanical appliance,
like the trigger of a gun, in the
Thunder Bird&#8217;s tail, would ignite it in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
flight. &#8220;You alone, girl as you are, know
the full secret of the Thunder Bird, as
you romantically call it, the principle
on which I am working, child&#8211;in so
far as you can understand it&#8211;in creating
this model rocket for experiments
and the master sky-rocket, the full-fledged
Thunder Bird, later, to soar
even to the moon itself&#8211;Mars, too,
maybe&#8211;you alone know and you have
kept it dark. You&#8217;ve plugged like a
boy at your elementary physics in high
school, so&#8217;s to be <i>able</i> to understand and
sympathize&#8211;you&#8217;ve lived up to the
name I gave you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My chowchow name!&#8221; interjected the
girl, winking slily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! it is a mixture.&#8221; Her father
echoed her chuckle. &#8220;But I guess you&#8217;ve
been son and daughter both, you good
little pal&#8211;you sprite of the lab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Toandoah&#8211;oh! Daddy-man&#8211;I&#8217;m
so glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here there was a little laboratory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
explosion, a rocket of feeling fired off, as
the owner of that hybrid name, Pemrose,
came down from her pinnacle and,
perching upon a low tool-chest at the
inventor&#8217;s side, took the humbler place
she loved,&#8211;fellow of her father&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I used to wish I was all boy until
I became a Camp Fire Girl; that bettered
the betty element a little,&#8221; she confided,
the spice of her mixed cognomen floating
in her eye.</p>

<p>It was a joke with her, that chowchow
name&#8211;original mixture&#8211;and how she
came by it.</p>

<p>Her father, Professor Guy Noel Lorry,
Fellow of Nevil University,&#8211;Toandoah,
the inventor, she called him,&#8211;wearing
his symbol, a saw-toothed triangle,
embroidered with her own upon her ceremonial
dress&#8211;had at one time almost
prayed for a son, a boy who might
help him to realize the dream, even
then taking hold upon his heart, of conquering
not the air alone but space&#8211;zero
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
space, in which it was thought
nothing could travel&#8211;so that old Earth
might reach out to her sister planets.</p>

<p>He planned to call the boy Pemberton
after his own father.</p>

<p>Likewise the mother of the maiden in
green now seated upon the tool-box had
longed for a daughter and aspired to
name her Rose, in tender memory of a
dear college chum, a flower no longer
blooming upon earth.</p>

<p>And when the little black-haired mite
in due time came, when she opened upon
her father eyes blue as the empyrean he
hoped to conquer, he had cried out of a
core of transport lurking in the very heart
of disappointment: &#8220;Oh! by Jove, I
can&#8217;t quite give up my dream: let&#8217;s name
her Pemrose. If she had been a boy,
I&#8217;d have called her Pem.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young mother blissfully agreed&#8211;and
did not live long to call her anything.</p>

<p>Grown to girlhood, the sprite of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
laboratory, who had looked through a
spectroscope at seven, clapping her small
hands over the fairy colors&#8211;pure red,
orange, green, blue, violet, separated by
little dark, thread-like lines, each representing
some element in that far-away
upper air which her father hoped to
master&#8211;preferred for herself the boyish
Pem to the oft-worn Rose.</p>

<p>But in order to square accounts with
what she called the &#8220;betty&#8221; element in
her, she evened things up on becoming
a Camp Fire Girl by choosing a name
all feminine wherewith to be known by
the Council Fire.</p>

<p>Wantaam, signifying Wisdom&#8211;a Wise
Woman&#8211;was the title she bore as one
who wore the Fire Maker&#8217;s bracelet upon
her wrist and had pledged herself to tend
as her fathers had tended and her fathers&#8217;
fathers since time began, that inner,
mystic flame which has lit man&#8217;s way
to progress from the moment when he
forged a bludgeon to conquer his own

world, until, to-day, when he was inventing
a Bird to invade others.</p>

<p>And it was that Wise Woman who
spoke now; she, of all others, who knew
the secret of the magic Thunder Bird;
and who, trustworthy to the core, had
&#8220;kept it dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if I&#8217;ve &#8216;plugged&#8217; hard in the
past over those fierce first principles of
mechanics, electricity, optics, heat and the
rest&#8211;and those &#8216;grueling&#8217; laws of gravitation&#8211;that&#8217;s
just nothing, a scantling
compared to the way I&#8217;m going to study
and make a hit when I get on into college,&#8221;
she cried; &#8220;so&#8211;so that, some day, I can,
really, work with you, Toandoah&#8211;you
record-breaking inventor&#8211;oh! dearest
father ever was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laughingly, passionately she flung an
arm around the neck of the man in the
long, drab laboratory coat, half strangling
him as he bent over the two-foot
model rocket, testing it with his soul
in his finger-tips, from its cone-shaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
steel head to its steering compartment,
thence to the supply chamber with all
the little propelling rockets in it, down
to its complicated nozzle, or tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why! there&#8217;s no knowing
what you and I may be doing yet,
when we strain our wits to cracking,
is there, Daddy-man?&#8221; she exulted
further. &#8220;You say, yourself, that once
space is conquered, that horribly cold
old zero space outside the earth&#8217;s atmosphere,
anything devised that will move
through it, as our Thunder Bird can do,
then&#8211;then there&#8217;s no limit! We might
be shooting a passenger off to the moon
now, provided the Man in the Moon
would shoot him back,&#8221; gayly, &#8220;if only
the master sky-rocket, twelve times as
large as this little model you&#8217;re working
on for experiments, were ready. The
re-al moon-going Thunder Bird! Oh,
dear!&#8221; Her little fingers restlessly intertwined.
&#8220;How&#8211;how I can har-rdly wait
to throw the switch upon a mountaintop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
and&#8211;watch it <i>tear</i>, as the college
boys say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes&#8211;sometimes I&#8217;m inclined
to think it will never &#8216;tear&#8217;; that another
than I will be the first to reach
the heavenly bodies.&#8221; Toandoah sighed.
&#8220;For where are the funds coming from,
Pem, the little bonanza&#8211;fairy gold-mine&#8211;necessary
to gorge our Thunder Bird
for its record flight&#8211;fit it out for its
novel migration to the moon, eh?&#8221; The
inventor clasped his hands behind his
head, whistling ruefully. &#8220;Funds, child!
Already, it has pecked through the biggest
slice of mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but&#8211;ah! but&#8211;&#8221; the girl suddenly
flashed upon him a sky-blue wink&#8211;&#8220;ah!
but the third <i>nut</i> hasn&#8217;t been
cracked yet, remember, for the Bird to
peck at that. Isn&#8217;t it in four weeks
from now&#8211;oh! in five&#8211;&#8221; the slight
figure swaying like the blue-eyed grass
upon its tall green stem, blown by a wild
breeze&#8211;&#8220;in five weeks from now that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
the third drawer will be opened, containing
the third and last installment of Mr.
Hartley Graham&#8217;s queer, queer drawn-out
will. When it is&#8211;oh! when it is&#8211;maybe,
then, at last, there will be something
coming to the University, our University,
to benefit your inventions, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My child! when that third nut is
cracked, &#8217;twill only benefit a &#8216;nut&#8217;.&#8221; The
man chuckled drily now. &#8220;In other
words, the remainder of Friend Hartley&#8217;s
fortune, all that his sister, Mrs. Grosvenor,
hasn&#8217;t already got, will still be
held in trust by me, as executor of the
will, for&#8211;for that griffin of a younger
brother of his who cleared out over twenty
years ago and hasn&#8217;t sent a line to his
family since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Mr. Treffrey Graham&#8211;really&#8211;such
a&#8211;zany?&#8221; Pem asked the question
for the nineteenth time, her black
eyebrows arching.</p>

<p>&#8220;My word! &#8216;Was he?&#8217; A&#8211;a regular
hippogriff he was, child! A hot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
tamale, like that Mexican fruit which burns
you if you bite into it! At college one
could hardly come near him without
getting scorched by his tricks. Remember
my telling you about my putting
in an appearance in class one day&#8211;Physics
3&#8211;boasting of the latest thing in
student&#8217;s bags, setting it down beside me&#8211;and
not seeing it again for three weeks?
The terrible Treff, of course! The climax
came, as you know, when he locked a
gray-haired professor into the padded cell
for opposing baseball too early in the season,
while the campus was still soft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mer-rcy! And kept him there for
ages&#8211;in that stuffy little room, all
wadded and lined with brown burlap,
used for analyzing sound&#8211;the prof not
able to make himself heard!&#8221;</p>

<p>The listener, girl-like, drew fresh excitement
from a faded tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;that meant expulsion, of
course, and his family, one and all, turning
a cold shoulder on Treff, before he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
went away for good&#8211;nobody knew
where. His engagement was broken off.
His brother Hartley saw to that&#8211;married
the girl himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder&#8211;I wonder if the Terrible
Treff ever married?&#8221; Pem musingly
nursed her chin,&#8211;and with it a wildfire
interest in the &#8220;hot tamale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard he did. Somebody said so&#8211;somebody
who met him out West,
years ago&#8211;that he was a widower, with
a little son. But&#8211;apparently&#8211;he has
no more use for his family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more&#8211;no more than his sister,
Mrs. Grosvenor, has for us since you
were made executor of that outlandish
will, left, piecemeal in three drawers, to
be opened on the first three anniversaries
of Mr. Graham&#8217;s death&#8211;and not
her husband!&#8221; Now it was an entirely
new breeze of excitement, a stiffening,
pinching draught, which swept the
forest-green figure upon the tool-chest
until its voice grew thin and sharp and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
edged as the blades in the box beneath
it. &#8220;Oh-h, yes! she&#8217;s at daggers dr-rawn
with us now&#8211;on her high ropes all the
time, as you&#8217;d say. And&#8211;and she
sneers at your inventions, father! She
calls the rocket, the rocket,&#8221; half-hysterically,
&#8220;the moon-reaching rocket,&#8211;a
Quaker gun&#8211;a Quaker gun that&#8217;ll never
be fired, never go off&#8211;never hit anything!...
<i>Oh-h!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>With her hand to her green breast at
the insult, the girl bounded, blindly as a
ball, from her box, across the laboratory&#8211;and
on to a low platform.</p>

<p>Through her raging young body there
shot like a physical cramp the knowledge
that Quakers, noble-hearted Friends, did
not use any guns; that the mocking term
was but a by-word, a jesting synonym
for all that was impotent&#8211;non-existent
in reason and power&#8211;a dummy.</p>

<p>Savagely she applied her eye to the tall,
ten-foot spectroscope rearing its brazen
height from this low pedestal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>Without, beyond the glaring white-washed
laboratory, was a February world,
equally white, of zero ice and snow.</p>

<p>Through the spectroscope she saw a
world in flames&#8211;blood-red.</p>

<p>It was not more flaming than her
thoughts.</p>

<p>Her father&#8217;s transcendent invention
just a faddist&#8217;s dream! The Thunder
Bird a joke&#8211;a <i>Quaker Gun</i>!</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; Convulsively her little teeth
bit into her lower lip as she adjusted the
telescope portion of the instrument for
analyzing light&#8211;reducing it to prismatic
hues&#8211;a little.</p>

<p>And now, lo! a world brilliantly jaundiced&#8211;her
orange&#8211;the snow being a
wonderful reflector of the sun&#8217;s divided rays.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father! Father-r! I used to love
Una Grosvenor. Now I h-hate her!
If her mother made that hor-rid speech
about a Quaker gun, she repeated it, before
all the boys and girls in our Drama
Class, too! If I see her this afternoon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
at the Ski Club, the skiing party out at
Poplar Hill, I shan&#8217;t speak to her. And
we used to be so chummy! Why&#8211;&#8221;
the girl fluttered now, a green weathercock,
upon the two-foot platform&#8211;&#8220;why,
we used to stand side by side and measure
eyelashes, to see which pair was going to
be the longer. I&#8217;ll wager mine are now!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a veering laugh the weathercock
was here bent forward, striving to catch
some brazen glimpse of a winking profile
in the polished brass of the spectroscope.</p>

<p>Her father laughed: this was the Rose
side of her&#8211;of his maiden of the patchwork
name&#8211;the Rose side of her, and
he loved it!</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8211;but Poplar Hill! Poplar Hill!
Why! that&#8217;s away outside the city
line&#8211;out at Merryville,&#8221; he exclaimed,
a minute later, in consternation. &#8220;Goodness!
child, you&#8217;re not going off there
to ski to-day&#8211;in a zero world, everything
snowbound, no trolley cars running?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! the trains&#8211;the trains aren&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
held up, father.&#8221; The coaxing weathercock
now had a green arm around the
neck of the man in the long, drab coat.
&#8220;And I just couldn&#8217;t give up going! I&#8217;m
becoming such a daring ski-runner, Daddy-man;
you&#8217;ll be proud of me when you
see! Why! I can almost herring-bone
uphill; and I&#8217;m getting the kick-turn
&#8216;down fine.&#8217; Darting, gliding, stemming,
jumping downhill&#8211;oh! it&#8217;s such perfect
fun, such creamy fun; I&#8217;m not a
girl any longer, I&#8217;m just a swallow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One swallow doesn&#8217;t make a summer;
all this doesn&#8217;t change the weather.&#8221; The
inventor glanced anxiously through a window.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but it&#8217;s such a very short train-run.
Pouf! only six miles on the two
o&#8217;clock express bound north, why&#8211;why!
the very train that you and I will be taking,
later, Daddy-man, along in May, when
you try out experiments with that little
model rocket you&#8217;re working on now,
upon old Mount Greylock&#8211;highest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
mountain of the State. Oh-h! if ever a
girl&#8217;s thumb itched, mine does to press
the little electric button and start it off,
to fly up a couple of hundred miles, or so,
to send you back your golden egg, siree&#8211;the
first record from space. Oh!
through all the fun of slope and snow I&#8217;ll
be thinking of that the entire time to-day&#8211;the
whole, enduring, livelong time.
Yes!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>GIMCRACK ICE</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>She</span> was thinking of it two hours later&#8211;having
gained her coaxing point&#8211;seated
in the well-nigh empty parlor
car of the north-bound express, that green-aisled
Pullman being the first car behind
the cab and plodding engine which,
regardless of schedule, crept along slowly
and warily to-day upon ice-shod rails.</p>

<p>But as she caressed the honorable thumb&#8211;the
little girlish member which would
press the button while all the world wondered&#8211;and
peered out through a window
fairly frosted, lo! again she saw a landscape
dimly in flames&#8211;blood-red&#8211;as
viewed through the spectroscope of her
own raging thoughts.</p>

<p>For ice was within the car, as without.</p>

<p>There&#8211;there, seated almost on a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
line with her, on the other side of the
moss-green aisle, and only three other
distant passengers in the compartment,
was the girl whose caricaturing tongue
had repeated the indelible insult about a
Quaker gun; whose mother considered
her father a mere chuckle-headed dreamer,
with his visions of bridging the absolute
zero of space&#8211;just a mild three hundred
degrees, or so, lower than the biting breath
of Mother Earth at the present moment&#8211;and
reaching worlds far away amid
the starry scope.</p>

<p>Pemrose had kept her word about not
speaking. She just dropped one pointed
little icicle in the shape of a nod upon
her one-time friend as she sank into her
own swivel chair and threw off the heavy
coat with which she had covered her ski-runner&#8217;s
silken wind-jacket and belted skiing
costume of pure, creamy wool, with
its full freedom of knickerbockers.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Una&#8211;Una Grosvenor!&#8221;
Her face frosted over at the thought.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
&#8220;Oh, mer-rcy! how I hate her&#8211;shall
everlastingly hate her&#8211;for passing on
that sneer about the Thunder Bird....
And I know-ow her eyelashes
aren&#8217;t as long as mine now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mingled spice was in the furtive glance
which Toandoah&#8217;s little pal, his maiden
of the chowchow name, threw across the
narrow train-aisle at the delicate young
profile opposite, outlined against a crusted
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she still has that funny little
near-sighted stand in one of her dark
eyes, too&#8211;Una! Although they&#8217;re pretty
eyes&#8211;I&#8217;ll admit that!&#8221; mused the critic
further. &#8220;Goodness! won&#8217;t she open them
one of these days when the world is all
ringing with talk of Dad and his rocket:
when the Thunder Bird, the finished, full-fledged
Thunder Bird, undertakes its
hundred-hour flight to the moon....
For, oh! I know-ow that it will go, some
day&#8211;some day.&#8221; The girl stared passionately
now into the future in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
frostscript of the pane near her. &#8220;Man would
not let it fail, God <i>could</i> not let it fail&#8211;just
for lack of funds&#8211;however that
third nut may turn out&#8211;that third section
of a queer will!&#8221;</p>

<p>And now the mulled world outside
changed again, shading from blood-red to
fairy rose-color as seen through the spectroscope
of hope.</p>

<p>She became lost in the most magnificent
dream that ever entranced a Camp
Fire Girl yet&#8211;with any hope of fulfillment.</p>

<p>Standing of a starless night upon a lofty
mountain-top, she was looking up at
Mammy Moon, dear, silver-footed Queen,
so near to the heart of every Earth-daughter!</p>

<p>In the darkness she felt the eyes of the
whole world upon her&#8211;she but a satellite
reflecting her father&#8217;s light&#8211;its joint ear
was bent to catch the wild, triumphal
song-sob of her heart.</p>

<p>And at the words: &#8220;Ready! Shoot!&#8221;,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
Toandoah&#8217;s battle-cry, she was pressing
the electric button which, connected with
a switch in the Thunder Bird&#8217;s tail, would
start it off, pointed directly for the moon,
to light up that silver disc with a bright
powder-flash visible here on earth.</p>

<p>She was mesmerized by its wild, red
eye. She was watching it switch its rosy
tail feathers, two hundred feet long, that
dashing explorer, as, roaring, it leaped
from its mountain platform at incredible
speed for an incredible flight.</p>

<p>She was echoing the college boys&#8217; untamed
slogan: &#8220;Watch it tear; oh!
watch it tear&#8211;the fire-eater.&#8221;</p>

<p>She....</p>

<p>But what&#8211;what was this? Was she
tearing with it? Was she, she herself,
just a shocked girl, at the heart of its
rapid-fire explosions?</p>

<p>Was she being hurled with it through
space, blank space, Absolute Zero, below
what human instrument could register,&#8211;or
human girl encounter and live?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>All she knew was that she was being
flung, first forward, then backward; and
then, oh, horrors! against the train window
near her where glass was all splintering
and crashing, through which ice and
water, mad, mad water and ice, were
rushing together.</p>

<p>There was an awful, punching jolt, a
frenzied shriek of steam, a splashing, hissing
roar&#8211;that, surely, could not be the
steel Thunder Bird&#8217;s challenge, unless it
had suddenly become a wading goose&#8211;and,
lo! she was hurled straight out of
her dream across a Pullman aisle, fast
flooding, right into the girl with whom
she had once vainly measured eyelashes,&#8211;between
whom and herself had existed
that thin bridge of ice but one little
minute before.</p>

<p>Alas! poor human ice that couldn&#8217;t
stand a moment under the blows of
Nature&#8217;s ice-hammer.</p>

<p>Both pairs of girlish lashes were stark
with terror now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>&#8220;Una! Una! <i>Una!</i> Ac-ci-dent!
Tr-rain accident! Gone through&#8211;through
into&#8211;the&#8211;lake!&#8221; moaned
Pemrose, half stunned, yet conscious, as
she was ten seconds before, that they
had been crossing frozen water.</p>

<p>Water! A pale pond, now plainly
seen through awful, swirling, wave-blocked
window-gaps! Yet across its wan
and shattering crust there shone a trail
of fire, red fire, heart fire&#8211;vivid at that
moment as the Thunder Bird&#8217;s pink tail
feathers switching through the space of
horror&#8211;and somewhere in that stretched
consciousness which is beyond thinking,
Toandoah&#8217;s daughter knew that it was
the Camp Fire training in presence of
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Una! M-mer-rcy! Una! Water&#8217;s
r-rushing in-n&#8211;in so fast&#8211;through
windows&#8211;doors ahead&#8211;m-may dr-rown
right here, &#8217;less we can f-fight it&#8211;get out,&#8221;
was her struggling cry as, paddling desperately
like a little dog, she found herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
topping the flood, that lashing, interned
lake-water, now blotting out window-frames
on one side of the car&#8211;groping
with icy fingers for the painted ceiling of
the Pullman&#8211;then undulatingly sinking
below them on the other.</p>

<p>For it was a case just half-a-minute
before, while Pem was still sanguinely
loosing the Thunder Bird, of small pony-wheels
on the big express engine striking
a frog in the rails, an icy groove, and
skidding,&#8211;then recklessly plunging down
four feet, those runaway ponies, from the
low bridge which they were crossing on
to the ice, dragging the engine, the cab
and the two front cars with them.</p>

<p>And now&#8211;now&#8211;to the inventor&#8217;s
daughter, the girl-mechanic, who had
plugged so hard at her high school
physics that she might understand her
father&#8217;s work, came a thought that was
worse, worse even than the hiss of the imprisoned
flood, tossing her like a cork: the
engine might explode&#8211;the sneezing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
sobbing engine, with the steam condensing
in its boilers&#8211;wreck the car she was in&#8211;she
and Una!</p>

<p>No! She did not think of herself alone.
All the frail girlish ice was a gimcrack
now.</p>

<p>But the terrors of the swamped car,
that snuffling threat of steam ahead&#8211;a
deep bass uz-z-z!&#8211;momentarily made
a gimcrack of other things too&#8211;of everything
but the desperate instinct to get
out&#8211;free, somehow.</p>

<p>Calling upon Una to follow, she headed
for a dripping window-gap, to seize the
moment when the flood, now lower upon
that side, might give her a chance to
paddle through&#8211;scramble through&#8211;escape
on to the cracking ice, before the
opening was again blotted out.</p>

<p>But together with the cruelty of glass-splinters,
ice-spars scratching her set face,
came the shock of an inner splinter: an
inkling, somehow, that Una was helpless,
could not follow, that, battered by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
concussion, tossing like a log upon the
flood&#8217;s breast, her senses had almost left
her.</p>

<p>Many waters cannot quench love&#8211;the
love of a daughter for her genius-father.</p>

<p>In that moment&#8211;that moment&#8211;there
leaped up in the breast of Toandoah&#8217;s
child the fire, the red fire, which alone
can carry anything higher, be it rocket or
girl&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>They had called her father&#8217;s invention
a joke, a Quaker gun, Una and her mother.</p>

<p><i>Never</i> should they say that of his
daughter&#8217;s pluck: that it was a dummy
which would hit no mark,&#8211;or only to
save itself!</p>

<p>&#8220;Una!&#8221; Wildly she seized the other
girl&#8217;s creamy flannels, buoyed like a great,
pale water-lily upon the imprisoned lake-water.
&#8220;Catch&#8211;c-catch me by the belt&#8211;Una!
I&#8211;I&#8217;ll try-y to save you!
Oh-h! s-stick ti-ight now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the daughter of the man, still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
sitting afar in his quiet laboratory, fitting
little powder charges into a model
Thunder Bird, set herself to battle through
the swirling gap of that half-covered window-frame&#8211;clutched
and hampered now&#8211;yet
upholding, even if it was her daring
death-thought, Toandoah&#8217;s honor in the
flood.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> ice had been thick-ribbed, product
of a bitter winter, but it could not
withstand the shock of a hundred and
eighty tons of leaping locomotive&#8211;it
splintered in all directions.</p>

<p>Of the whole long train, however, only
two cars and the cab had followed the
engine&#8217;s plunge when those skidding pony-wheels
turned traitor, and were now ice-bound
and flooded in the middle of a small
lake, while the remainder of the fast express,
with one coach actually standing
on its head, hanging pendent between
the ice and the bridge, was not submerged.</p>

<p>It was as if a steel bar were hurled
violently at that solid ice, when one end
only would pierce the crust and the remainder
be left sticking, slanting, up.</p>

<p>When Pemrose, a Camp Fire Girl of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
America, greater at that moment than
when her hand should loose the Thunder
Bird, because she was determined that
whatever might be said of her father&#8217;s
invention, nobody should ever say that
his daughter&#8217;s courage was a Quaker gun,
paddled through the window-gap of that
swamped Pullman, towing Una, she found
herself in such a vortex of zero water and
shattered ice that all the strength behind
her gasping breath turned suddenly dummy.</p>

<p>&#8220;S-stick tight, Una! Oh-h! stick
tight,&#8221; was the one little whiff that speech
could get off before it froze&#8211;froze stiff
behind her chattering teeth, in the pinched
channel of her throat.</p>

<p>And then&#8211;then&#8211;she was clinging to
the jagged spur of an ice-cake, her left
hand convulsively clutching Una&#8217;s flannels,
while the eddies in the half-liberated water
around them, spreading from a blue-cold
center to a white ring, made horrid eyes&#8211;goggle-eyes&#8211;which
stared at them.</p>

<p>To Pem&#8211;little visionary&#8211;plunged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
from her dreams of pressing the magic
button on a mountain-top, of watching
the Thunder Bird tear, tear away moonward,
switching its long tail of light, the
whole thing seemed an illusion&#8211;the
wrong side of her dream.</p>

<p>It was as if she had soared with that
monster rocket, Toandoah&#8217;s invention,
outside the earth&#8217;s atmosphere, were being
hurled about in the horrible vacuum of
space, its unplumbed heart of cold, so far&#8211;so annihilatingly far below the balmy
zero point of old Mother Earth on a
February day when two light-hearted girls
were going skiing.</p>

<p>She was growing numb.</p>

<p>In vain did her waterproof wind-jacket,
the ski-runner&#8217;s belted jacket of thin and
trusty silk, defend, like a faithful wing&#8211;a
warm, conscious wing&#8211;the upper
part of her body.</p>

<p>The deadly water was encroaching,
clasping her waist with an icy girdle,&#8211;stealing
under it, even to her armpits.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>And the petrifying little hand which
had left its fistling in the train,&#8211;the
thick mitten that should have grasped
the balancing stick in all the wild swallow-fun
of climbing, stemming, darting amid
slope and snow upon a wintry hillside&#8211;could
not hold on very long to the glacial
spur.</p>

<p>The ice-cake was threatening to slip
away, to seesaw, turn turtle and waltz
off, to the tune of blood-curdling sounds:
screams for help here, there, everywhere,
always with the background of that menacing
hiss of steam in the great engine&#8217;s
boilers&#8211;that low, sneezing uz-z-z! as if it
were taking cold from its bath&#8211;the engine
that, at any moment, might explode.</p>

<p>Frantically she would have struck out,
the little girl-mechanic, and fought the
whole ice-pack to get away from that
threat, to reach a solid crust, but she
knew that she could not &#8220;swim&#8221; two,
herself and Una.</p>

<p>Yet would they go under&#8211;one or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
both&#8211;perish in water not deep because of
the starving cold, even if&#8211;if the
engine...?</p>

<p>Her teeth snapped together upon the
thought, its diddering horror. Surely, it
was as bad a predicament as could be
for a girl!</p>

<p>But, suddenly, through all the horripilation
there seemed to shine a light.</p>

<p>Somehow, Pem was conscious of it in
the poor numb sheath of her own girlish
being&#8211;and beyond.</p>

<p>And she knew that her stark lips were
praying: &#8220;Oh! Lord&#8211;oh! Father&#8211;help
me-e to hold on. Don&#8217;t let us&#8211;go&#8211;under!
I want&#8211;I want so-o to live to
see Daddy&#8217;s rocket go off!... He ...&#8221;</p>

<p>The stiff sobs tumbled apart there, as
it were.</p>

<p>But the Light remained, the Presence,
so near as it seemed to Pem at the moment&#8211;even
as she had felt it before
upon a mountain-top, or at some matchless
moment of beauty&#8211;that she almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
lisped confusedly: &#8220;Daddy in Heaven!&#8221;
as once, a two-year-old, she had prattled
it at her father&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>Then what&#8211;what? Another voice
prattling near her&#8211;chattering icily! A
bully human voice!</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh! Something r-rotten in the
State of Denmark,&#8221; it gasped. &#8220;Jove!
I like excitement, but I&#8217;d rather be warm
enough to enjoy it. Oh! Dad, if there
are any others left in that car, the one
on end, you help &#8217;em. I must attend to
these girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;T-take her first&#8211;Una!&#8221; flickered
Pem, a spicy flicker still, as she felt a strong
grasp on her shoulder and looked up into
the face of a broad-shouldered youth in
a gray sweater; the engine might explode,
but, to the last, they should not say of
Toandoah&#8217;s daughter that her courage was
a Quaker gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove! but you&#8217;re game,&#8221; flashed the
youth. &#8220;Well, keep up&#8211;hang on&#8211;I&#8217;ll
be back in a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>The minute was three.</p>

<p>He had to lift the second girlish victim
almost bodily out of the water and drag
her with him as he wriggled and crawled
over the broken ice-pack, to reach a firm
spot, where he picked her up and&#8211;with
all the vigor of an athletic eighteen-year-old&#8211;carried
her to the shore, now not
more than twenty yards off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I was just in time, wasn&#8217;t
I?&#8221; he ejaculated on the transit. &#8220;By
George! You&#8217;ve got pep, if ever a girl
had&#8211;I&#8217;ll wager you pulled your friend
out of the parlor-car and held her up!
Some horripilation, eh?&#8221; breezily. &#8220;Now&#8211;now
what have you and I ever done
that the Fates should wish this on to us&#8211;that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was what the daring little ski-runner,
Pem, herself, had been vaguely wondering;
she liked this jolly wit-snapper who preferred
his excitement warm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! there goes the engine exploding,&#8221;
he gasped a moment later, as he set her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
down. &#8220;Bursting inward! Now, if it had
done the mean thing, burst outward, piling
up the agony, doing a whole lot of
damage, &#8217;twould have been quicker about
it.... Oh&#8211;you! Dad,&#8221; to a gray-bearded
man, with a gray traveling cap
pulled down almost to his eyes. &#8220;Here,
I&#8217;ll hand over these girls to you now!
Will you look after them? I&#8217;d better
go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simultaneously there was a low, sullen
roaring, the crack of doom, as condensed
steam sucked in the heavy steel casing of
the locomotive&#8217;s boilers and shattered it
like an eggshell.</p>

<p>In Pemrose it shattered something too.</p>

<p>Wildly she looked into the eyes of the
man in the tourist&#8217;s cap and was conscious
that in one of them horror was frozen
into a fixed stand, as it was in one of
Una&#8217;s, as he helped her up a snowy bank.</p>

<p>And, with that, her brain laid its last
egg for the present, as the Thunder Bird
would drop its expiring one upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
dead surface of the moon, in the knowledge
that, the Fates notwithstanding, she was
still alive&#8211;still alive, to see the great
rocket go!</p>

<p>And as for its completion&#8211;as to the
little gold mine necessary to gorge it for
its record flight&#8211;why! the third rich
nut of which she had spoken a little while
ago in her father&#8217;s laboratory, had not
yet been cracked: the third mysterious
drawer containing the third and last installment
of a dead man&#8217;s very strange
will had not yet been opened.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>The Second Wreck</span></span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>That</span> third nut was cracked just five
weeks later in the firelit library of what
had been Mr. Hartley Graham&#8217;s home&#8211;the
home of a man who during his
lifetime, so it was occasionally said, had
been, in some ways, almost as eccentric
as his madcap brother&#8211;and concerning
the latter his college chums, those who
knew him long ago, were of the opinion
that he was a freak whose &#8220;head grew beneath
his shoulder.&#8221;</p>

<p>The house, a white marble mansion on
Opal Avenue, finest of the old residential
streets in the University city of Clevedon,
was now occupied by the sister of the
two, the mother of Una, who had snapped
her fingers at the Thunder Bird, calling
it a joke, a dummy, a Quaker gun.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>That jeering nickname still rankled in
the breast of Pemrose, who looked more
like a colorless March Primrose, owing
to the lingering shock of that train wreck,
upon the spring morning in early April
when the family lawyer whose duty it
was to settle the affairs of the man who had
left three separate portions of his will in
as many drawers, to be opened on three
successive anniversaries of his death, drew
forth the last.</p>

<p>She was not the only pale girl present.</p>

<p>By her side was Una, neighbor again in
heart as in body, who laid one little agitated
fist on Pem&#8217;s knee while preparations
for reading the will were being made,
the two girls nestling together, as in
chummy days, three years before, when in
the peacock pride of thirteen they had
conceitedly measured eyelashes.</p>

<p>And the remorseful affection mirrored
in that little near-sighted stand in one of
Una&#8217;s pretty dark eyes was only typical
of an entirely similar state of feeling in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
the once scornful breasts of her father and
mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grosvenor was no longer &#8220;on her
high ropes,&#8221; as Pem had said in her father&#8217;s
laboratory; to-day she seemed to be,
rather, on a snubbing-line which brought
her up short now and again, even in the
middle of a speech, when she looked at
the inventor&#8217;s blue-eyed daughter, his
trusty little pal&#8211;and that, sometimes,
with spray in her eyes, too.</p>

<p>Also, her glances in the direction of
the inventor himself, Professor Lorry, with
whose name the world was already beginning
to ring, were appealing&#8211;not to
say apologetic.</p>

<p>She was quite sure now that any man
who could turn out a daughter, not yet
sixteen, to behave in a fearful emergency
as Pem had done&#8211;without whom her
own daughter would not be here to-day,
as Una constantly kept repeating&#8211;could
never forge a gun, be it rocket or rifle,
that would hit no mark!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>She even expressed some agitated
interest in the great invention, inquiring
when the first experiments with the little
model Thunder Bird, upon a mountain-top,
were to take place.</p>

<p>And as for her husband, he boldly declared
himself deeply interested in the
conquest of the upper air and space&#8211;so
far beyond the goal which any aviator
had dreamed of reaching yet.</p>

<p>He even went so far as to say that he
would be glad to see the remainder of a
fortune, represented by that third section
of a will, go for the furtherance of the
professor&#8217;s wonderful moon-reaching,
planet-reaching scheme, instead of being
&#8220;hung up&#8221; awaiting the return of the
dead man&#8217;s younger brother who had
been such a queer flimflam fellow in youth,&#8211;whose
family did not even know whether
he was dead or alive.</p>

<p>And, at first, while the shell of that
third nut was being solemnly cracked
by the reading of opening sentences of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
the will&#8211;oh! how the heart of Pemrose
jumped, like a nut on a hot shovel&#8211;it
did seem as if the kernel were going
to be a rich one for the Thunder Bird.</p>

<p>For now, according to the testator&#8217;s
wish, if his brother, Treffrey Graham,
had not yet returned to claim his portion
of his elder brother&#8217;s wealth, then
the money&#8211;a little bonanza, indeed, a
solid fortune&#8211;was to be turned over,
forthwith, to the University of his native
city, to be used for developments in the
science of the air&#8211;the upper air and
what lay beyond it&#8211;chiefly for the
furtherance of any inventions that might
be put forward by the dead man&#8217;s trusted
friend, Professor Lorry.</p>

<p>It was here that two pale girls, abruptly
transformed from April primroses to June
roses&#8211;oh! such pinkly blooming tea-roses&#8211;gave
simultaneously a wild little shriek.</p>

<p>It was here that Pem, dazzled, saw the
Thunder Bird, with a clear sky, tear&#8211;tear
away moonward&#8211;and noticed at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
the same time, through some little loophole
in the watch-tower of her excitement,
the figure of a man with a gray
tourist&#8217;s cap pulled down to his eyes,
rather waveringly crossing the street without.</p>

<p>He circled to avoid an April puddle,&#8211;she
saw him clearly through the broad library
window, at a distance of some fifty yards,
beyond a flight of marble steps and a
graveled entrance.</p>

<p>A queer little shiver, a horrid little shiver&#8211;a
snowflake in summer&#8211;drifted down
her spine!</p>

<p>The figure had an icy background.
She had seen it before amid the terrors of
that February train-wreck. The boy who
saved her, the boy with the jolly tongue
in his head, humorous amid the &#8220;horripilation,&#8221;
had addressed it as Dad.</p>

<p>And then&#8211;then, she caught her
breath sharply, as something blew upon
her, hot and cold together&#8211;and came
back to the library, to the present moment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>For the gray-haired lawyer, with his
mouth opening gravely, wide as a church
door, with a little forward pounce of his
body upon the typewritten sheets, the
sheets that meant life or death&#8211;flight
or stagnation&#8211;for the Thunder Bird,
was beginning to read again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but that&#8217;s not all, even yet!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;This curious will has dragged
its slow length over three years&#8211;and
now we haven&#8217;t finished with it, quite.
Here&#8217;s a codicil still to be read&#8211;its
last word, written later, just two days
before Mr. Graham&#8217;s death, so it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alack and alas! that was the moment
of the second wreck; the moment for one
jubilant girl of the dire breakdown, when
the Victory Express to Clover Land, goal
of blossoming success, crashed through
into zero waters of blankest disappointment,&#8211;almost
as bitter as those in which
she had held up her friend.</p>

<p>For the last word of the strung-out
will set forth that, whereas it seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
borne in upon Mr. Hartley Graham, with
life drawing to a close, that he had not
been quite fair to his madcap brother in
youth, and that the latter would some
day return, the disposal of his wealth in
the other direction named&#8211;to the University
and for invention&#8211;should not
come into effect for at least twelve years
after the opening of that third drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so&#8211;and so, it&#8217;s all hung up for
another dozen years&#8211;unless Treffrey
Graham comes back to claim the money!
Well! I&#8217;m sorry, Professor Lorry; there&#8217;s
many a slip &#8217;twixt cup and lip,&#8221; said the
lawyer, laying down the codicil with a
blue look; he was interested in invention,
progressive invention&#8211;he had never
thought that the Thunder Bird was a
Quaker gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so it&#8217;s all hung up for the next
twelve years,&#8221; was the baffled cry which
went around the circle, with no single
note of longing for the wanderer&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>It would not have been very flattering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
to the terrible Treff, if he was alive and
present to hear, thought a gnashing Pemrose:
to the exile who had been such a
hazing firebrand at college, burning out
the fine flame of youth in the straw blaze
of senseless pranks,&#8211;a griffin and shatterpated
jester.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>She Saved a City</span></span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>And so</span>&#8211;and so it&#8217;s all hung up for
another twelve years&#8211;the Thunder
Bird&#8217;s flight! For I don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;s
much chance of the money coming from
another direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pemrose Lorry echoed the cry, repeated
it desolately, hours later, standing
in her own room&#8211;a room that was
a sort of sequel to herself, as every Camp
Fire Girl&#8217;s nest should be.</p>

<p>Her father had echoed it, as she sat
very close to him, driving home in the
Grosvenor&#8217;s limousine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! so far this strung-out will has
been for us much cry and little wool, eh,
girlie,&#8221; he muttered; and for the first
time she heard discouragement in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
voice; perhaps he had &#8220;banked&#8221; upon
that third nut more than he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the money is hung up for the next
dozen years, as far&#8217;s any benefit to the
invention is concerned,&#8221; he went on presently,
just before his own home was
reached. &#8220;I&#8217;d better be putting my time
into something else, I guess,&#8221; with a raw
scrape in the tones. &#8220;How&#8211;how about
a machine for the manufacture of paper
clothing, eh, or airdrawn rugs&#8211;&#8221; sarcastically&#8211;&#8220;prosperity,
<i>riches</i>, in that!
Ha! Get thee behind me, Satan&#8211;but
don&#8217;t push!&#8221; added the inventor whimsically,
thrusting his head out of the auto
window,&#8211;with a sound that was neither
laugh nor groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get thee behind me, Satan&#8211;and don&#8217;t
push!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears sprang to those blue eyes of Pemrose
now, as she recalled the half-piteous
tone in the voice.</p>

<p>Toandoah was discouraged. Toandoah
was tempted&#8211;tempted to sacrifice the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
highest claim of his intellect, his original
dream, or the dream whose originality he
had made practical, of reaching the heavenly
bodies; of being a pioneer in exploring
the Universe outside his own earth and its
enveloping atmosphere; of finding out the
secrets of that mysterious upper air, and
where it ended, of getting back a record
of it&#8211;the Thunder Bird&#8217;s golden egg, the
first record from space.</p>

<p>And the girl in her buoyant young heart
of hearts felt that hope&#8211;nay, certainty&#8211;were
still there, green, springing, as
the first signs of happy springtime in the
world outside.</p>

<p>How&#8211;how was she to make him feel it;
she his little Wise Woman, his laboratory pal?</p>

<p>Her eye went to the emblems upon
her wall: a pine tree on a poster, typical
of strength, a banner with a sunburst, the
sun shedding warmth upon the earth.</p>

<p>And then&#8211;then! To the little squat
figure of a woman, as the Indians depicted
her, with a torch in her hand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
Wisdom&#8217;s torch&#8211;her own emblem as
Wantaam of the Council Fire.</p>

<p>But there was another representation
of that Wantaam&#8211;that Wise Woman.
Pem had designed it herself, painted it
herself upon a two-foot poster, gaining
thereby a green honor-bead for handicraft.</p>

<p>And before that the girl, wrestling with
the heavy disappointment of that tantalizing
will, brought up&#8211;her hands clasped.</p>

<p>It was a curious scene: a lot of little
tents with a wall around them, the same
symbolic figure of the woman with the
torch stood upon the wall, pointing a stiff
arm at a man outside, a warrior, who
had a knife in hand.</p>

<p>Underneath were printed in flaming
characters two Indian words: &#8220;Notick!
Notick!&#8221; signifying: &#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always did feel fascinated by that
Wise Woman who saved&#8211;a&#8211;city.&#8221;
Pem looked adoringly at her handiwork.
&#8220;A besieged Jewish city, away back in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
King David&#8217;s time! To be sure, one
reads of it in&#8211;in what&#8217;s a bloodthirsty
chapter of the Old Testament! And she
saved the town by ordering the death of
a rebel, a traitor, proclaiming that she,
herself, was loyal and faithful to the
king&#8211;so were her people&#8211;making
Joab, David&#8217;s captain, that man with
the knife, outside the wall, listen when
she cried to him: &#8216;Hear! Hear!&#8217; She
had more sense than the men about her&#8211;and
one isn&#8217;t told the least thing
further about her, not even her name.
That&#8217;s what makes her mysterious&#8211;and
fascinating.... Yet she saved a city!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl drew a long breath&#8211;a suddenly
fired breath.</p>

<p>Was it up to her now to save a city:
the citadel of her father&#8217;s courage&#8211;of
that rose-colored conviction which is half
the battle on earth or in the air? How
was she to do it?</p>

<p>Her eye went wandering around the
room. Trained to the eloquence of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
symbols, it lit on something. Just a sheen
of pearls and a little loom upon a table&#8211;myriads
of pearly beads, woven and unwoven,
with here and there a ray of New
Jerusalem colors, ruby, emerald, blazing
through them&#8211;the New Jerusalem of
hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah-h!&#8221;</p>

<p>Breathlessly she caught it up, that something,
four feet and a half of the beaded
history of a girl,&#8211;pearl-woven prophecy,
too!</p>

<p>Hugging it to her breast, that long
leather strip, an inch and a half in width,
on which her glowing young life-story
was woven in pearls, with those rainbow
flashes of color&#8211;the loom with it&#8211;she
hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, did a professor&#8217;s laboratory,
the stern, hardware &#8220;lab.&#8221; of
a mechanical engineer, react to anything
so fairy-like as when Pem, scurrying
down a flight of stairs to the workshop
which her father had fitted up in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
his own house&#8211;not his University laboratory
with the tall spectroscope&#8211;sat
down to a table and began industriously
to weave.</p>

<p>Turning from a bench where he sat
fiddling with a steel chamber, part of the
anatomy of a fledgling Thunder Bird, of
one of those small model rockets which
he was fitting up for experiments on a
mountain-top, the inventor watched her
listlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! What&#8217;s the charm now, the
thing of beauty? That&#8211;that looks
such stuff as dreams are made of.&#8221;
Toandoah drew a long breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t dream-stuff, father; it&#8217;s
history, the history of your life and mine,
all told in symbols, woven into a chain,
a stole&#8211;see&#8211;to wear with my ceremonial
dress. It&#8211;it&#8217;s my masterpiece.&#8221;
Pem looked up, all girl, all Rose, now.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to show it to you until
it was finished. But now&#8211;now&#8211;don&#8217;t
you want to see it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>Listlessly, still, her father drew near,
his tall figure in its long, drab laboratory
coat looming like a shadow behind her
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;See there&#8211;there&#8217;s where it begins
with the Flag I was born under, the
Stars and Stripes,&#8221; excitedly. &#8220;And look,&#8221;
softly, &#8220;that gold star stands for Mother
who died when I was two. And there you
are, Toandoah, with that queer Indian
triangle having the teeth of a saw, the
emblem of invention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! That funny, squat figure, with
something like a three-cornered fool&#8217;s-cap
on my head and the moon above it, looking
through a tube!&#8221; There was a laugh
in the inventor&#8217;s throat now; the grim
&#8220;Get thee behind me, Satan!&#8221; look, with
the cloud of that codicil to a will, were
melting away from him. &#8220;Well, go on!&#8221;
he encouraged smilingly. &#8220;Artistic, anyhow!
I believe you Camp Fire Girls would
weave magic around a clock pendulum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And here&#8211;here am I&#8211;Wantaam,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
a Wise Woman. There&#8217;s the Thunder
Bird, see, the symbol of the great rocket.
Here are you and I, Dad, upon a mountaintop,
watching it tear&#8211;oh! tear away.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed again at the two stiff,
woodeny figures, the comet-like streak
of fire above them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this&#8211;the quill fluttering down
attached to a kite! Humph! That
stands for the Thunder Bird&#8217;s diary, I
suppose, otherwise the golden egg&#8211;the
little recording apparatus coming down on
the wing of its black parachute.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inventor laughed amusedly again,
glancing sidelong at <i>his</i> masterpiece, the
little five-inch openwork steel box, having
in it two tiny wheels with paper wound,
tapelike, on one and a pencil between
them. This carried in the head of the
Thunder Bird, big or little, would keep a
record of as high as it went by the pencil
automatically making marks so long as
there was any air-pressure, like a guiding
hand, to move it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The weaver nodded. &#8220;And
here&#8211;here is the Will being read!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girlish voice was lower now, the
girlish feet treading doubtful ground, as
she pointed again to those two quaint,
stubby figures, with a third one reading
from a parchment.</p>

<p>But there was no doubt at all in the
young voice which presently gathered itself
for a climax.</p>

<p>&#8220;And see&#8211;see there&#8211;those little
yellow dots I&#8217;m weaving in now; those
are gold pieces, father, the money that
<i>is</i> coming to us from somewhere for you
to finish your invention. Yes! and I&#8217;m
going on to weave in the moon, too, and
the little blue powder-flash before her face,
to show the Thunder Bird has got there.
For it is going to get there, you know!&#8221;
Pem&#8217;s blue-star eyes were dim now, but
in them was the wisdom of babes&#8211;the
wisdom oft hid from the wise and prudent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy-man!&#8221; She bowed her head
over the pearl-woven prophecy, speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
very low. &#8220;I could always tell you
my thoughts. Somehow, at that awful
time of the train-wreck, when we were
in the icy water, Una and I, before the
boy came, the big boy who saved us,
through&#8211;through all the &#8216;horripilation&#8217;,
as he called it, I seemed to see a light;
the&#8211;the Light of Light Eternal, as we
sing&#8211;God&#8211;and I knew, oh-h! I
knew-ew, at the last, that we weren&#8217;t going
to dr-rown.... I know just as certainly
now that you&#8217;re going to launch the Thunder
Bird, to go-o where nothing&#8211;Earthly&#8211;has
ever gone before.... Father-r!&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence fell upon that passionate little
cry in the dim workshop.</p>

<p>Only the beauty of the pearl-woven
thing upon the table spoke&#8211;the record
to go down to posterity.</p>

<p>Then into the silence tiptoed the voice
of a man, whimsical, slightly, yet with
a touch of tender awe in it, too:</p>

<p>&#8220;And none knew the Wise Woman
who saved the city!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>A Hotspur</span></span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Oh!</span> I&#8217;m so glad&#8211;just so glad I
don&#8217;t know what to do with myself&#8211;that
those experiments with the lesser
Thunder Bird, the smaller sky-rocket,
which won&#8217;t make the four-day trip to
Mammy Moon, but will only fly up a
couple of hundred miles, or so, and drop
its golden egg, the diary, to tell you
where that blank No Man&#8217;s Land of
space begins will still be carried out
this spring from the top of old Mount
Greylock. If they had been given up,
it would have broken my heart&#8211;so
it would!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evening now, late evening, in
the dining room of the professor&#8217;s home,
looking upon the green University campus.</p>

<p>The girl with the grafted Rose in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
name, grafted on to a foreign stem, was
pouring out her father&#8217;s after dinner
coffee&#8211;and her own full heart, at the
same time. &#8220;Ouch!&#8221; She shivered
a little. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to think of that
&#8216;diddering&#8217; cold of empty space; not&#8211;not
since the train-wreck. I&#8217;m like the
big boy who saved us then, and was so
jolly; I&#8217;m out for excitement if I&#8217;m
warm enough to enjoy it, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Well, here&#8217;s somebody
who&#8217;s willing to take a chance on carrying
his warmth, his fun too, with him
into space.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor laughed as he drew a
sheet of thick letter paper, broad and
creamy, from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! is it somebody else ... you
don&#8217;t mean to say it&#8217;s another hotspur
applying for a passage in the real Thunder
Bird when you start the big rocket
off for the moon, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl glanced over her father&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>&#8220;Yes, one more candidate for lunar
honors! And this one is the limit for
a Quixote. Young, too, I should say!&#8221;
Again Toandoah&#8217;s deep chant of laughter
buoyed his daughter&#8217;s treble note, as he
began to read:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;Professor G. Noel Lorry,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevil University.<br />
My dear Sir,</p>

<p>Having learned that you are perfecting an apparatus
that will reach any height&#8211;even go as far as
the moon&#8211;and that it will be capable of carrying
a passenger, I should like to volunteer for the trip.</p>

<p>I have always wanted to say &#8216;Hullo!&#8217; to the Man
in the Moon, on whose face I have often looked
from an aÃ«roplane already; and I am ready to try
anything once&#8211;even if it should be once for all!</p>

<p class='tar mr30'>Yours for the big chance,</p>
<p class='tar'>T. S.</p>

<p>P. S. I respectfully apologize for not being able
just at present to give my full name, but will, with
your permission, furnish it later.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Mr. T. S.! &#8216;With your permission,&#8217;
where do you write from?&#8221;
Pemrose bent low over the primrose sheet.
&#8220;Oh! from Lightwood. Now,&#8211;now
where is that, Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s a little, one-horse village of
the name among the Berkshire Mountains,
not far from fashionable Lenox.&#8221;
Her father smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lenox! How lovely! Why! that&#8217;s
where you and I are going to stay&#8211;stay
for a week or two&#8211;isn&#8217;t it, father,
<i>en route</i> for Greylock and the experiments.
You know the Grosvenors have
invited us&#8211;and they have a wonderful
old place up there. Una&#8217;s mother is
carrying coals these days&#8211;&#8221; Pemrose
winked&#8211;&#8220;coals of penitence in her
heart for ever having sneered at your invention,
Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot ones, are they? Well! I wish
she&#8217;d hasten and spill them out before
she reaches Lenox.&#8221; The inventor
chuckled. &#8220;Let me see, she was born
there, I believe, at their mountain home&#8211;yes,
and one or other of her brothers, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Was it&#8211;was it the unicorn; I&#8211;I
mean the oddity; the Thunder Bird&#8217;s
rival for all-l that money?&#8221; The girlish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
hand shook now as it wielded the coffee-pot.
&#8220;Oh, dear! wouldn&#8217;t his horn be
exalted if he never came back?&#8221; With a
droll little catch of the breath. &#8220;Una and
I are as friendly as ever now, Dad,&#8221; ran
on the girlish voice, hurriedly leading off
from the neighborhood of the will. &#8220;And
she&#8217;s to be taken out of school early, when
we go, because she has been so nervous
since the train-wreck. So chummy we
are&#8211;oh, as chummy as in the old days
when we measured eyelashes and she
laughed at my &#8216;chowchow&#8217; name!&#8221; The
speaker here shot the bluest of glances
through those twinkling lashes at their
reflection in a neighboring teapot, older
than Columbia herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chowchow, indeed! It just suits you,
that compound. There&#8217;s a vain elf in
you somewhere, Pem, that sleeps in the
shadow of the Wise Woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe&#8211;maybe, there&#8217;s a nickum!
That&#8217;s Andrew&#8217;s word, Andrew&#8217;s word for
an imp, a tomboy. He&#8217;s the Grosvenors&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
Scotch chauffeur, you know, who talks
with a thistle under his tongue. Well!
nickum, or not!&#8221; the girl was a rosy
weathercock again. &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;m just dying
to get up to the mountains, to climb the
Pinnacle, the green Pinnacle, that rough,
pine-clad hill, with Una&#8211;and sit in the
Devil&#8217;s Chair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What!</i> My Wise Woman sitting in
the Devil&#8217;s Chair! Why! &#8217;twould take
a daredevil nickum, indeed, to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inventor threw up his hands, laughing
again, as he beat a retreat to his hardware
den, his laboratory, where there was
ever a magnet, potent by night or day, to
draw him back.</p>

<p>Yet when still another six weeks had
passed and Pemrose, with all the green
world of spring in her heart, stood, breathless,
upon that Lenox pinnacle&#8211;a pine-clad
mountainette some thirteen hundred
feet above sea-level&#8211;lo and behold! there
was a nickum sitting coolly in the Devil&#8217;s
Chair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>A brazen feat it was! For that Lucifer&#8217;s
throne was a curved stone seat, a natural
armchair, rudely carved out of the precipice
rock, more than a dozen sheer feet beneath
the crest where she stood with Una&#8211;Andrew
of the thistly tongue having driven the
two girls up to the foot of the peak on this
the third day after their arrival, with the
May flies, amid the mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nickum&#8211;oh! a nickum, indeed&#8211;a
daredevil nickum&#8211;sitting in the Devil&#8217;s
Armchair, with his feet dangling down&#8211;down
over the deep precipice! Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pemrose pirouetted in excitement at the
sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and, goodness! he seems to be
enjoying it, too. Not turning a hair.
Oh! if &#8217;twere I&#8211;I should be so-o dizzy.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the more timid cry in her pulsing
throat, and that little appalled stand, a
star of mingled consternation and admiration
beaming, bewitched, in one dark eye,
Una turned from the spectacle&#8211;turned,
shuddering, from the hundred-and-odd feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
of unbroken abyss extending from the
nickum&#8217;s knickerbockered legs, nonchalantly
swinging, to an awed grove of
young pine trees, rock-ribbed and bowlder-strewn,
far below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t want to look at him,&#8221;
she cried cravenly. &#8220;How will he&#8211;ever&#8211;climb
back up here again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tr-rust him&#8211;&#8221; began Toandoah&#8217;s
daughter, then suddenly clutched her throat,
her widening eyes as round, as bright, as
staringly blue as the mountain lupine already
opening upon the world&#8217;s surprises,
in sunny spots, among the hills.</p>

<p>Those eyes were now fastened to the
back of the nickum&#8217;s close-cropped head,
to his broad shoulders in a rough, gray
sweater, noting a certain &#8220;bully&#8221; shrug
of those shoulders at the surrounding
landscape, as if, monarch of all he surveyed,
he yet felt himself a usurper in his
present seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something rotten&#8211;something rotten
in the State of Denmark!&#8221; crowed Pemrose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
softly. &#8220;I wonder if he&#8217;s getting that off
now? Una! Una! It&#8217;s He ... He!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man&#8211;the boy&#8211;who saved us
after the train-wreck ... without whom
we mightn&#8217;t be here&#8211;now! Ah-h!&#8221; was
the softly tremulous answer, as the blue
eyes danced down the rock, with frankest
recognition, friendliest expectation, to that
daring, nonchalant nickum figure, now
coolly drawing up its toes for a climb.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>The Pinnacle</span></span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>It</span> was an exciting situation.</p>

<p>Pemrose, who like the enthroned daredevil
liked excitement, if she was warm enough
to enjoy it, had not hoped for quite such a
tidbit when she came to the mountains,&#8211;at
least, short of the little Thunder Bird&#8217;s
record-breaking flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I did so want to run across him
again. I do so long to thank him! Why&#8211;why!
we might never have escaped
from that awful wreck, got out of the zero
water, but for him, Una.&#8221; The blue eyes
were wet now, frankly wet, bluebells by
a mountain brook&#8211;the little bursting
brooklet of feeling within.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;d like to thank him, too!&#8221;
gushed Una, with that little fixed star
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
twinkling most radiantly in one dark eye,
the slight stand which characterized it
only at intense moments when feeling
reached indefinite altitudes. &#8220;Oh! how
glad I am now,&#8221; she ran on breathlessly,
&#8220;that we made Andrew leave the car down
in a garage at the Pinnacle&#8217;s foot and bring
us up here for a sort of picnic supper,&#8221;
sending a sidelong glance scouting round
for the tall, capped figure of the grizzled
chauffeur who, a brief ten years before,
had been driving his &#8220;laird&#8217;s&#8221; car upon
Ben Muir, a heathery mountain of his
native Highlands.</p>

<p>Trustworthy as day, a capable driver
and zealous Church Elder, he was one
to whose guardianship Una Grosvenor,
the apple of her parents&#8217; eye, might safely
be intrusted with her visiting friend while
her father golfed and her mother lunched
and played bridge in complacent peace
of mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! she&#8217;s all right with Andrew;
he&#8217;s such a true-penny!&#8221; was her father&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
dictum. &#8220;Safer with him, up here, than
she would be with maid or housekeeper!
And, after that shock in the winter, the
doctor wants her to be out of doors among
the hills morning, noon and night&#8211;practically
all the time, if she can!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah! so far, so good. But just at this
unprecedented moment of excitement
Andrew, the true-penny, had encountered
another Scot, who emigrated before he
did, and was breezily &#8220;clacking&#8221; with
him at some distance from where two
breathlessly expectant girls gazed down
upon the black top of the nickum&#8217;s
head&#8211;and at his wheeling shoulders in
the great armchair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;oh! there he goes&#8211;see&#8211;curling
up his legs, drawing up his feet
carefully, turning in the seat&#8211;standing
up!&#8221; cried Pemrose, all Rose at this
crisis, prematurely blooming, as if it were
June, not May, as she stood on tiptoe to
meet a dramatic moment, reveling in the
thought that the daredevil did not know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
what a surprise awaited him on top here,
what a welcome&#8211;heart-eager gratitude.</p>

<p>She bit her lip, however, upon the impulsive
cry, for she saw two girls, younger
than herself, with a ten-year-old boy, who
had been watching the climber&#8217;s feat from
a near-by mound, turn and look at her
curiously.</p>

<p>They were evidently acquainted with
the daring usurper of the Devil&#8217;s Chair.</p>

<p>For, having drawn up his legs until
his knees touched his chin, then raised
himself to a standing position on the
grim stone seat, cautiously turning, his
strong fingers gripping the granite chair-arms,
when his back was to the precipice
beneath and his face almost touching
the twelve-foot, well-nigh perpendicular
rock which he had to climb, he actually
had the hardihood to wave his hand to
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&#8211;now comes the &#8216;scratch&#8217;!&#8221; he
shouted laughingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to hook
on to that &#8216;nick&#8217; in the rock, there, just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
over my head, and draw myself up. Had
to &#8216;shy&#8217; it coming down&#8211;for fear it
would catch in my clothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I&#8211;didn&#8217;t I t-tell you it
was him?&#8221; burst forth Pem, with all
the vehemence of a little spring torrent, in
Una&#8217;s ear as she caught the ring of the
chaffing voice which had railed at the
Fates for &#8220;wishing a wreck on&#8221; to unoffending
youth, and was so boldly challenging
them now.</p>

<p>And just as free and frank in her girlish
gratitude as that torrent bubbling impulsively
out of the earth, when the nickum
reached the crest again, she sprang forward,
hand outstretched, to meet him.
Her eyes, blue as the little fairy blossoms
of the star-grass now, were breeze blown
in the meadow of her gladness.</p>

<p>It was nothing&#8211;nothing not to know
the name of one who had saved you from
death, she thought.</p>

<p>By the rescue you knew him!</p>

<p>And he knew her!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>Those eyes, those keen, girlish eyes
which had looked through the spectroscope
a hundred times, in her father&#8217;s
laboratory, into the remote mystery of
that far-away upper air could not be
deceived.</p>

<p>By the sudden, startled heave of his
shoulders, whose defiant shrug she remembered
so well, by the quick intake
of breath, as its climbing hiss sharpened
to a whistle&#8211;almost a rude whistle in
the excitement of the feat he had just
performed&#8211;by the little stare of breathless
surprise, of quandary, in his dark eyes,
glowing like Una&#8217;s, he recognized her ...
and passed her by.</p>

<p>Recognized her as the girl whose &#8220;pep&#8221;
he had complimented for putting another&#8217;s
life before her own&#8211;and didn&#8217;t want
to have anything more in life to say to her!</p>

<p>Well! the Heavens fell upon the Pinnacle
as Pem drew back&#8211;annihilated.</p>

<p>Snubbed for the first time in all her
blue-sky life&#8211;and by a boy, too!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>To be sure, indeed, the nickum, his
glance darting past her to Una, had gone
by with a slight inclination of his bare
head that was a stony bow.</p>

<p>To be sure, when one of the girls of his
acquaintance questioned him about the
view from the Devil&#8217;s Seat, there was a
sort of creak in his voice as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8211;a&#8211;corker! You can see
away off: far-rms, lakes, all the other
mountains&#8211;Mount Greylock, too, in the
distance! But&#8211;but it&#8217;s a cat&#8217;s-foot climb
down&#8211;there!&#8221; breaking off breathlessly,
as if feeling were making a cat&#8217;s-paw of
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you can really see Mount Greylock!
As far away as that! Well! I&#8217;m
going to try-y it, too,&#8221; ventured one of
his girlish companions whose age was
fourteen. &#8220;Summer and winter, I&#8217;ve done
a lot of climbing, up here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try it! Any girl try sitting in
the Devil&#8217;s Chair! Why! there isn&#8217;t a
girl living who could do it,&#8221; crowed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
gray-shouldered youth: and now his tones
were lordly, as if he were picking himself
up after an inner tumble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! Is that so?&#8221; Pem&#8211;over-hearing&#8211;ground
the words between her
teeth.</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Have you never heard of Camp Fire,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we&#8217;re on the map,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to prove it with s-snap!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>She hissed the last word at the nickum&#8217;s
back, as he halted at some distance with
his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Una! I&#8217;m going to do it,&#8221; she panted.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to slide down that rock there,
turn round and sit in the Chair&#8211;then
draw myself up again, as he did. I&#8217;ve
got on sneakers. I know I can! I&#8217;ve
done some breakneck climbing with father&#8211;yes!
and with my Camp Fire Group,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;ll give you all my marshmallows
that we brought with us to toast at an
open fire, if you do!... Yes! and
one of my two little thistle pins&#8211;pebble
pins&#8211;that Andrew and his wife brought
me from Scotland, when they went home
last year, <i>if you do</i>.... Wasn&#8217;t he
just hor-rid? He didn&#8217;t want to speak
to us&#8211;to know us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Una&#8217;s face flamed upon the bribe, and
was so pretty lit by that fixed star in the
eye, that it must have been a zero-hearted
nickum who could turn his back upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold my hat,&#8221; said Pem: if she had
been a boy, the tone would have meant:
&#8220;Hold my coat while I thrash him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Unhesitatingly she stepped to the precipice-brink
and measured the distance to
that Devil&#8217;s Chair very coolly and critically
with her eye.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>A Usurper</span></span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Gathering</span> her short, green skirt about
her, for she wore, as on that February
day in her father&#8217;s laboratory, what he
called the &#8220;nixie green&#8221;, the sylvan Camp
Fire uniform, the inventor&#8217;s daughter
stretched herself breast downward, upon
the flat ledge of the Pinnacle&#8217;s crest.</p>

<p>Working her body carefully backward,
without another glance at the precipice
beneath, she slid warily over the edge,
her face to the rock, and down the dozen
feet of almost smooth, nearly perpendicular
slab, until her feet touched the stone
seat of that curved armchair, a deep
embrasure in the mountain granite.</p>

<p>It was not such a wildly difficult feat
then for a girl on her mettle to turn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
cautiously until her tingling back was pressed
hard against the slab, and thus to lower
herself to a sitting position on the rocky
throne.</p>

<p>For that Devil&#8217;s Chair was a spacious
one&#8211;fairly so! The seat extended outward
at least three feet and was roomy
enough to allow of two people standing
upright on it at the same time.</p>

<p>And what a view old Lucifer must have
from it, was Pem&#8217;s first thought&#8211;provided
he didn&#8217;t, as an Irishman would
say, reside away from home!</p>

<p>Off to the right and left stretched the
wonderful landscape of the Berkshire Hills,
Massachusetts&#8217; Highlands&#8211;the Berkshire
mountains in May where, afar, a summit
snow-cap vied with the driven snows of
blossoming fruit trees, lower down; where
the pink-shot pearl of a lake gleamed,
opal-like, from an emerald setting, and
many a silver thread winding, expanding,
showed where some madcap river or brook
had become with spring a wild thing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>&#8220;Oh, hurrah! I can really see off to
Mount Greylock&#8211;old King Greylock&#8211;even
the steel tower upon it&#8211;oh! so
plainly,&#8221; murmured the madcap in the
Chair, and nestled triumphantly against
its rocky back.</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Greylock, cloud-girdled, from his purple throne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shout of gladness sends,</p>
<p>And up soft meadow slopes, a warbling tone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Housatonic blends.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Yes! she felt as if they were two throned
dignitaries, she and Greylock; for she
wore the crown of derring do, and King
Greylock, still wearing a thin diadem of
snow, was enthroned for ever in her imagination
as the favored peak from which
the first experiments with her father&#8217;s
immortal rocket were to be made.</p>

<p>Upon Greylock&#8217;s crest within a week
or two, maybe&#8211;at all events before summer
dog-day heat clogged and fogged the
air&#8211;her transcendent dream&#8211;or the first
part of it&#8211;would come to pass: her
yearning thumb would press the button
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
and start the little Thunder Bird off, to
fly up a couple of hundred miles, or so,
with its diary in its cone-shaped head,
and send back that novel explorer&#8217;s log,
the little recording apparatus, attached
to a black silk parachute&#8211;the first, the
very first record from the outer realm of
space.</p>

<p>No wonder that old Greylock sent her
back a shout of gladness now, as, squirming
in the Chair, she turned her gaze
away from the distant mountain to green
meadow slopes, to the right, where the
broadest silver ribbon, intertwined with
the matchless landscape, showed where
the Housatonic River, the blue Housatonic,
flowed and sang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! I wouldn&#8217;t have missed
this for anything,&#8221; she exulted silently.
&#8220;But the idea of that perfectly horrid
boy actually daring me to do it! He
didn&#8217;t mean to, but he did&#8211;strutting
off, like that, crowing about his climbing!
As if a girl were&#8211;gingerbread! Well&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
indignantly&#8211;&#8220;that was just one with
his passing Una and me when we only
wanted to thank him, felt as if we naturally
must thank him, for&#8211;for.... Bah!
I won&#8217;t think of the horrid wreck now!
Or of him, either! I&#8217;ll be taken up with
the view! Isn&#8217;t it exquisite&#8211;sublime?
Not interrupted as it is up there on the&#8211;Pinnacle&#8217;s&#8211;crest!...&#8211;Ah-h!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little pinched exclamation came when&#8211;all
too suddenly&#8211;she changed the point
of view, and looked down.</p>

<p>Beneath her yawned the precipice over
which her feet dangled&#8211;treading air, with
never a break between them and that grove
of dwarf pine trees more than a hundred
feet below, pointed by their glinting rocks.</p>

<p>The little trees bowed to her, now, like
servants&#8211;green pages.</p>

<p>But, somehow, their homage made her
feel uneasy; it put too great a distance
beneath her and them.</p>

<p>The crown of daring which she wore
did not fit quite so easily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>She began to feel like a usurper whose
head might at any moment be taken off.</p>

<p>And, with that, she decided to vacate!</p>

<p>Drawing up her feet much more gracefully
than her predecessor had done, she
curled her body in the seat and raised it
slowly until she was in a standing position,
grasping the stone arms of the chair,
turned&#8211;turned rather sickeningly, to be
sure, until her breast was against the
broad rock down which she had slid,
then reached upward for a handhold by
which to climb&#8211;to draw herself up.</p>

<p>There was one. The nickum&#8211;churlish
climber&#8211;had pulled himself up by
it. Like him, she had fought shy of it,
sliding down, for fear it should catch in
her clothing.</p>

<p>A little spur it was, projecting from a
slight fissure, what he called a &#8220;nick,&#8221; in the
rock, rather more than half-way up,&#8211;a
good seven feet from the rocky armchair.</p>

<p>Breathlessly she reached upward, to
grasp it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>And, lo! her lips fell apart&#8211;like a
cleft stone.</p>

<p>At the same time her heart slunk out of
her body and dropped into the precipice
behind her.</p>

<p>Her fingers just missed that spur&#8211;fell
short!</p>

<p>They touched it; they could not curl
over it&#8211;and grip.</p>

<p>Flattening herself to a green creeper
against the rock which seemed spurning
her, wildly she stretched every tendril&#8211;every
sinew.</p>

<p>In vain! Make as long an arm as she
could, this daring Pem, her five feet three
of slim girlish stature would not become
the five feet nine of the daredevil who
preceded her!</p>

<p>Emergency balks at extension.</p>

<p>That right arm, racked, fell limply back.</p>

<p>The blue of her eyes, hooking to the
spur, if her fingers couldn&#8217;t, grew glazed
like enamel.</p>

<p>She felt as if she were tumbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
backward already, the daring essence of her,
to break her too spunky backbone among
those glowing pine-dwarfs far beneath.</p>

<p>Spread-eagled against the rock&#8217;s cruel
breast, she turned a blanched face, a convulsed
face, upward!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>Jack at a Pinch</span></span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Keep</span> cool! Don&#8217;t stir! I&#8217;ll reach
you in a moment!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the cry, the reassuring cry, came
ringing down to her, Pemrose felt the
blood start again from where it was frozen
at the back of her neck and surge through
her flattened body, which, greenly spread-eagled
against that gray rock, the head
turned slightly aside, was not unlike the
quaint Indian figure of the Thunder Bird
upon a pedestal,&#8211;the emblem of her
father&#8217;s invention.</p>

<p>As the first blind moment of terror
passed&#8211;the blankness of the discovery
that, strain as she might, she could not
reach that spur of the rock, the nearest
hand-hold, and draw herself up to safety&#8211;she
saw two rescuing figures loom out
on high.</p>

&#8220;Keep cool! Don&#8217;t stir! I&#8217;ll reach you in a moment!&#8221; <i>Page</i> 86.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>The first was that of the chauffeur,
Andrew, summoned by a piercing cry
from Una&#8211;Una whose delicate face was
white and square now as the marshmallows
in the box under her arm, with which she
had bribed her friend to the madcap feat
of sliding backward down a twelve-foot
rock and sitting in the Devil&#8217;s Chair.</p>

<p>And Andrew the Scot saw the danger,
heard it skirling in his ears, for he had
been brought up among mountains.</p>

<p>He did not quite see what good he could
do, that staid Church Elder, by joining
the girl in the Devil&#8217;s Seat.</p>

<p>But he came of a Campbell clan which
never flinched.</p>

<p>He was preparing to slide down, himself,
when an arm&#8211;a left elbow rather&#8211;thrust
him rudely back.</p>

<p>&#8220;T-take hold of this rope-end. Throw
yourself flat on the ground there. Sit
on him, you girls, so that he may not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
be drawn over!&#8221; cried a voice, pointed,
vigorous.</p>

<p>Pem knew that it was the fiery voice of the
nickum, the broad-shouldered youth, who
had sat in the chair before her, whose
crowing had been responsible for her feat.</p>

<p>Her colorless face was turned upward
then and she had seen him push up the
lower folds of his sweater with his left
hand&#8211;even while its elbow sent the
chauffeur back&#8211;and while his right,
lightning-like, uncoiled a rope, a lariat,
worn under it around his waist.</p>

<p>It was then that he shouted to her to
&#8220;keep cool&#8221;; and that she, turning her
head aside against the rock, became a
living effigy of the Thunder Bird.</p>

<p>Not waiting to make the rope fast around
his own body&#8211;or his body fast to it&#8211;he
slid down.</p>

<p>The next moment he was standing beside
her in the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! So the &#8216;pep&#8217; was in the wrong
box that time,&#8221; he said coolly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>&#8220;Yes. Last time it was in the ice-box,&#8221;
snapped she, as coolly, not to be outdone.
&#8220;So you <i>did</i> remember&#8211;know me&#8211;us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I help&#8211;remembering&#8211;that
icy train-wreck?&#8221; He was slipping
the rope in a noose under her arms. &#8220;Perhaps,
some day.... Well! I&#8217;m glad
to be &#8216;Jack at a Pinch&#8217; again, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;R-ready!&#8221; he shouted then.</p>

<p>And Pem was drawn up, to face a Highland
squall from Andrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoot! lassie, an&#8217; air ye sech a fechless
tomboy that a mon mun keep his een
sticket on ye a&#8217; the time?&#8221; the Scot
angrily demanded. &#8220;How cud ye be sech
a nickum as to try sitting in yon&#8211;Deev&#8217;s
Chair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask&#8211;ask the other nickum; he did
it first,&#8221; flung back the rescued one.</p>

<p>But under cover of the broad scolding,
the other, the Jack at a Pinch&#8211;friend
in need for the second time&#8211;had again
slipped off, without a word from either of
the girls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>&#8220;Bah! he is a nickum&#8211;a mysterious
imp,&#8221; snapped Pemrose, the fire that
smoldered behind her white face leaping
up. &#8220;Can&#8217;t be shyness with him; he
doesn&#8217;t look the least bit shy! Oh-h!
what a fool I was to give him a chance to
help me&#8211;save me&#8211;in a &#8216;pinch&#8217;, again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears were springing to her eyes now,&#8211;tears
of reaction.</p>

<p>She felt that an eighteen-year-old youth,
privileged to save her life twice&#8211;it
seemed a privilege at the moment&#8211;might,
at least, have had the manners to
let her thank him for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he&#8217;s the nicest and the&#8211;hor-rid-est&#8211;boy
I ever saw,&#8221; wailed Una,
in tribute to the train-wreck, still a nightmare
on her mind.</p>

<p>Both girls were dumfounded, as well
they might be.</p>

<p>Pemrose, with her blue eyes under jet-black
lashes&#8211;girdled, moreover, with
her father&#8217;s growing fame&#8211;Una, with
lighter eyelashes and hair, and that little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
fixed star of angry excitement blazing
in one sweet dark eye, they were the kind
of girls whose good graces a boy would be
the last to spurn, fair even for daughters
of Columbia who, democratic in beauty,
as in all else, never hatches out an ugly
duckling.</p>

<p>They gazed in stormy bewilderment now
after Jack at a Pinch walking off with his
party whom, indeed, he had herded away.</p>

<p>Andrew was looking gloweringly after
him, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; so he&#8217;s the loon that sat in the
Chair first!&#8221; grumbled the still angry
chauffeur. &#8220;Aw weel&#8211;&#8221; the &#8220;dour&#8221; expression
upon the speaker&#8217;s long upper
lip softening a little&#8211;&#8220;weel! he may be
ill-trickit, but he&#8217;s a swanky lad, for a&#8217;
that. Aye, fegs! an&#8217; braw, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he&#8217;s &#8216;swanky&#8217; enough&#8211;swaggering&#8211;but
I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s &#8216;braw&#8217;,
handsome&#8211;not with that little stand in
his eye&#8211;just like Una&#8217;s, only more so.&#8221;
Pem added the last words under her breath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
&#8220;But, oh! for goodness sake! let&#8217;s get
away from here,&#8221; she cried wildly; &#8220;over
to the other side of the Pinnacle, anywhere&#8211;anywhere&#8211;so
that we won&#8217;t see
him again, before his strutting over what
he&#8217;s done, makes me&#8211;makes me&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;it&#8217;s pretty on the other side
of the hill, easy climbing, much smoother&#8211;green
and spring-like,&#8221; assented Una
soothingly, pouring balm. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
covered with young pine trees and just
a few, very few, tall silvery birches. Not
rough and rocky as it is this side!&#8221; glancing
shiveringly down the precipice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not another Deev&#8217;s Chair in sight,
I&#8217;ll be hoping&#8211;fegs!&#8221; muttered Andrew,
picking up a basket which he
had carried from the automobile up the
low mountainside, and in the late emergency
had set down.</p>

<p>It contained cocoa, sandwiches, fruit
and other toothsome dainties for a picnic
supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have permission to make a fire,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
a Pin-na-cle blaze, to&#8211;to boil water
and toast our marshmallows. Oh! of all
things, all-ll things on this planet&#8211;I
don&#8217;t know what we may find on any
other&#8211;that&#8217;s &#8216;banner&#8217;, it&#8217;s a marshmallows
toast out-of-doors&#8211;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
chanted Una, intoning her delight to the
trees, the low spruce and pine scrub, as
she skipped among them, an evergreen
sprite, herself, for she, too, now wore the
&#8220;bonnie green&#8221;, the Camp Fire short
skirt, middy blouse and captivating Tam-o&#8217;-shanter&#8211;most
nymph-like note in
dress for daughters of the woodland.</p>

<p>&#8220;And&#8211;and I just know the dear-est,
loveliest pin-ey nook,&#8221; she went on in a
choir-boy sing-song; &#8220;half-way down the
Pinnacle&#8217;s softer side it is, where we may
build our fire. Halleluiah! I suppose I&#8217;ll
have to get busy and gather fagots, as in
Camp Fire rank I&#8217;m a Wood Gatherer.
Oh, dear! Will you listen to old Andrew.
Now what is <i>he</i> singing?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Scot, indeed, relaxing from prim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
silence and chauffeur ceremony here upon
the Pinnacle&#8217;s height, with only two young
girls to marshal instead of the mechanism
of lever and brake&#8211;although the former,
as he had found to his cost might prove
the worse handful of the two&#8211;was alternately
whistling, with lips drily pursed,
and crooning in the burr-like accents which
adhered like a thistle to his tongue, his
version of a very old song:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thwacks &#8217;em!&#8217; Pshaw! he&#8217;s flinging
that in my direction&#8211;having a fling
at me&#8211;for sitting in the Devil&#8217;s Chair,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
laughed Pem, but the laughter was bitter,
two-edged. &#8220;Oh! Una,&#8221; she burst forth
shakily, &#8220;as long&#8211;as long&#8217;s ever I live,
I&#8217;ll wish I hadn&#8217;t done it, letting&#8211;letting
that Jack at a Pinch, as he called
himself, that big, boorish boy, play friend
in need to me-e again. Ugh-h!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her stung lips quivered and were twisted,
partly upon the after-taste of terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! forget it&#8211;oh-h! forget it,&#8221;
caroled the younger girl. &#8220;See that you
don&#8217;t make a trouble out of it, for trouble
is a hor-rid kettle-o&#8217;-fish for the troublers&#8211;see!...
But&#8211;listen! Listen!
Surely that&#8217;s singing&#8211;singing from somewhere&#8211;<i>other</i>
singing!&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused on tiptoe, a green dryad,
one little hand, fair as a flower-petal,
curled about her startled ear.</p>

<p>But Pem was for the moment comfort-proof.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t quite so easy to forget,&#8221;
she murmured, bitterly.</p>

<p>Her less fragile fists were mounted one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
upon another under her chin as if to
hold her head up. For the first time in
her life she felt as if she were being asked
to drink a cup of humiliation&#8211;she, Toandoah&#8217;s
little pal&#8211;and she made wry
faces over even a sip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Doesn&#8217;t it seem queer&#8211;queer&#8211;outlandish?&#8221;
she snapped, bolstering
the piqued head higher with each
passionate adjective. &#8220;Here for three
months, ever since February&#8211;since I
recovered consciousness after that freezing
wreck&#8211;I&#8217;ve been longing, oh! longing
to meet again the boy whose chaff,
whose very chaff, warmed one amid the
horrors.... You didn&#8217;t hear it; you
were too far gone. And, <i>now</i>!&#8221; The
little fists lashed out. &#8220;Bah! Who could
ev-er dream that he&#8217;d turn out such a
&#8216;chuff&#8217;, as the boys say&#8211;an un-civ-il
chuff?... Una! it&#8217;s never&#8211;it isn&#8217;t,
it can&#8217;t be Camp Fire Girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is! It is! I told you I heard
singing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>The answer was shrill with delight as
the wiry note of the little black-poll
warbler, nesting near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! Why! Goodness! That&#8217;s
what I hurled at <i>him</i>; at his crowing,
cock-a-hoop back!&#8221;</p>

<p>The older girl&#8217;s face softened, melted
into whimsicality now,&#8211;into a freakish
surprise that encircled, like a golden ring,
her wide-open mouth.</p>

<p>Up&#8211;up from the Pinnacle&#8217;s softer side,
its tender, heavenly side, the chant came
ringing, the merry chant and challenge:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on the map,</p>
<p>R-ready to prove it with snap!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Snap was in the very sunset as the
evening breeze learned the song.</p>

<p>As for the inventor&#8217;s daughter, her joyous
relief was now a hop and now a dance,
anon a pine-caught hullabaloo, as she
gleefully turned her back upon the Devil&#8217;s
Chair and nickum memories&#8211;her face
to the glowing sun of sisterhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Camp Fire sisters! Camp Fire sisters!
Was ever such luck?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh!
come, let&#8217;s find them&#8211;let&#8217;s join them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;let us!&#8221; assented Una, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
excitement, too, running like wildfire
through the wood.</p>

<p>And, presently, the two city girls, wafting
themselves airily over bowlders, threading
their way in and out among pigmy
pines, with here and there a needled patriarch
among them, came upon a forest
scene that might well have wakened
Queen Mab from her sleep in a cobweb
net and made her think that some, at least,
of the fairy dreams with which she inspired
mortals had come true.</p>

<p>A dozen, and more, of sylvan figures,
the green tassels of their Tam-o&#8217;-shanters
waving like the tasseled green of the cinnamon
fern flitted busily in and out among
their passive brothers, the trees, not pines
here, but a few beautiful stripling birches
planted in a sunny spot.</p>

<p>To these white-stemmed saplings, tall
and taper-like, some of the nymphs,
maidens from thirteen to seventeen, were
playing fairy godmother, affixing to their
slender trunks placards proclaiming the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
exaction of dire forfeits from any wanton
human churl found guilty of mutilating a
silver birch tree, stripping it even of an
inch of tender skin, thus entailing upon
it decay and death.</p>

<p>Other of the maidens were gathering
fagots for an outdoor fire to the tune of
a version of Andrew&#8217;s song, not without
humor in the present crisis:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Singing whack fol de ri do,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Twill comfort their souls,</p>
<p>To get such fine fagots,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When they&#8217;ve got no coals!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>One, brisk spoon in hand, was busily
stirring some fairy brew, batter rather&#8211;an
older figure superintending, Queen
Mab herself maybe, having a golden sunburst
embroidered upon the heaving
emerald of her breast.</p>

<p>Now! to these came forth two other
maidens, emerging, breathless, from the
Pinnacle pines, and made the hand-sign
of fire.</p>

<p>Up went gracefully a dozen green arms,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
in charming tableau, as the woodland
nymphs paused in their work, their curving
fingers typifying the warmth of the
curling flame behind the finger&#8211;the
Camp Fire welcome to heart and hearth.</p>

<p>A genial flame which the Guardian&#8211;she
of the golden maturity&#8211;put into
winsome words, as she approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome&#8211;thrice welcome,&#8211;Sisters!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;We are the White
Birch Group of Lenox, at present engaged
in protecting our younger brothers,
the little trees which we planted ourselves.
I am Tanpa&#8211;signifying Birch&#8211;Guardian
of the Group; in everyday life just
Myra Seaver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my name is Lorry&#8211;Pemrose
Lorry&#8211;my ceremonial name Wantaam,
a Wise Woman.&#8221; Here the spokeswoman
for the two strangers had the grace to
blush, remembering the Devil&#8217;s Chair.
&#8220;And this&#8211;this is my friend, Una Grosvenor,
who has just been initiated into
&#8216;Camp Fire.&#8217; We belong to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
Woo-hi-ye&#8211;Victory&#8211;Group of Clevedon
which, you know, is only a hundred miles,
or so, from here; and we&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Tanpa&#8217;s face had become suddenly
fascinated&#8211;illumined&#8211;to rival the sunburst
upon her breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pemrose!&#8217;&#8221; She echoed the words
softly, with transient glow. &#8220;How novel&#8211;and
pretty! But&#8211;Lorry! Oh-h!
you don&#8217;t mean to say&#8211;you don&#8217;t tell
me&#8211;that you&#8217;re anything to the great
inventor, of whom the whole world is
talking: the professor who has invented
an apparatus to&#8211;to travel anywhere
through the air, through space&#8211;even to
reach the moon?... Ah-h, there she
is now! I wonder if she&#8217;s listening to
us!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, indeed, at that moment that
Yachune herself, the Silver Queen, showed
her placid face above the Pinnacle pines,
pale on the rim of the waning sunset.
Did she dream of the Earth-valentine in
store for her, mild old Mammy Moon?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>No knowing! The Pinnacle, the green
Pinnacle, towered until it seemed very
near to her with the mounting pride in
one girl&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toandoah, the inventor, is my father&#8211;oh!
Professor Lorry, I mean. The Thunder
Bird&#8211;the record-breaking Thunder Bird&#8211;is
his invention. I call it that; an ordinary
rocket he says it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well! the sky was in Pem&#8217;s eyes, of a
truth, now, enough blue to make a Blue
Peter, the flag of embarking, the flag of
adventure; no rudeness of &#8220;nickum&#8221;,
earthbound, boastful, could ever humiliate
her again, with Toandoah&#8217;s emblem in
her heart.</p>

<p>Yet, as she felt the Guardian&#8217;s saluting
kiss upon her young forehead, so starred
by fate, as she was introduced, one by
one, to her sisters of the White Birch
Group and was invited, she the center of
a flattering fuss, to sit with them by a
Pinnacle blaze, instead of being at the
pleasant pains to build her own fire, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
thoughts would turn back&#8211;turn back
every now and again, to Jack at a Pinch!</p>

<p>To the quick-witted, surefooted youth,
so daring, if so unmannerly&#8211;such a
chuff&#8211;who had not even waited to make
the rope fast around his own body before
sliding down the rock to the Devil&#8217;s Chair
a second time&#8211;and who had, a second
time too, climbed, unaided.</p>

<p>But she said nothing of him&#8211;or of
her recent escapade.</p>

<p>And she was glad that Una didn&#8217;t!</p>

<p>Instead, she bathed every sore spot
left by the experience in the glory of telling
her new friends all that she might tell of
the romantic, space-conquering Thunder
Bird, while, above, the Man in the Moon,
eavesdropping, learned of the surprise in
store for him.</p>

<p>Perhaps he cribbed some hint, too, from
the excited girlish tongue of the demonstration
so soon to take place upon Mount
Greylock, when the invention would be
tried out; and lastly of the thrilling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
invitation to the White Birch Group to be
present&#8211;not then&#8211;but on that Great
Day, far ahead, when the real Thunder
Bird, full-fledged with magic, red-eyed,
fiery-tailed, would embark on its hundred-hour
flight moonward, as Pem was sure
it would start, no matter where the gold-mine
to equip it came from.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! we seem, truly&#8211;truly&#8211;to be
treading the &#8216;margin of moonshine land&#8217;,
don&#8217;t we?&#8221; said the Guardian dreamily,
enchantment in her voice. &#8220;I&#8211;almost&#8211;feel
as if, some day, we might be inviting
the Man in the Moon to supper
with us here on the Pinnacle, to shoot
himself back in the small hours. Joking
apart, it does draw the Universe very
near together, doesn&#8217;t it&#8211;open the road
to such wonderful possibilities!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her hands came together as she gazed,
that graceful, green-clad woman, speechless,
transfigured, along the aÃ«rial high-road
on which the Thunder Bird would
first pay toll by dropping its golden egg,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
its record, off&#8211;off beyond the low night-clouds
to the mysterious sky-ways where
daylight now mated with dusk and the lunar
lamps were being softly lighted, even to
the gateway of Mammy Moon herself.
Throbbing, she flushed from head to heel, as
she thought of the two hundred and thirty
thousand miles to be traversed before the
first barrier between the heavenly bodies
had been let down&#8211;and the Thunder
Bird had won home.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8211;too&#8211;gr-reat for words,&#8221; she
said, a break in her voice now. &#8220;Well-ll!
if we are not playing hostess to the Man
in the Moon&#8211;quite yet&#8211;at least, we
seem to be entertaining angels unawares,
with the latest rumors from the sky,&#8221;
laughingly. &#8220;How about supper now?
Later on maybe we can show you two
dear girls that we&#8211;as a Group&#8211;can do
something with red fire, too, a very earth-bound
something, mere child&#8217;s play compared
to the future of your celestial Bird.
Ha! But&#8211;what&#8217;s&#8211;that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>And then, for the first time in its yet
unwritten story, the Thunder Bird had its
nose put out of joint by a modest little
earth-bird&#8211;a hermit, too, as it would
be among the starry spaces&#8211;by a little,
brown-backed evening thrush singing its
good-night song in a thicket of scrub
near by.</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;O wheel-y-will-y-will-y-<i>il-l</i>!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>it caroled, as a naturalist has translated
the wonderful, silver-sweet prelude of the
master-singer of the woods, the nightingale
of America, rising, trilling until&#8211;now&#8211;with
the voice-throwing magic of the ventriloquist,
its song seemed to come from
quite another corner of the thicket, while
girls&#8217; hearts melted in their breasts, as,
climbing a maypole of ecstasy, the notes
trembled&#8211;fluted&#8211;upon a gossamer pinnacle
of gladness at the close of a perfect
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-h!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no breath in girlish bodies for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
more than the one answering note of
passion.</p>

<p>No wonder the Thunder Bird&#8217;s nose
was out of joint.</p>

<p>Earth has a magic all her own.</p>

<p>But was it ventriloquism at large? Had
the hermit power to throw his melody
right into the center of the ring of girls&#8211;so
to answer himself?</p>

<p>It was the visitors&#8217; turn now for a stupendous
sensation.</p>

<p>Almost as airy and flute-like, though
not as liquidly sweet and soaring, were bird-notes
which answered back from within
the very halo of Pemrose herself; and
she turned, with her heart in her throat,
to see who&#8211;who had the thrush in her
pocket.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Surely</span>, it was the sweetest grace ever
said.</p>

<p>A duet between a hermit thrush and a
Camp Fire Girl! Pinnacle vespers!</p>

<p>If gladness did not flow freely now,
then human hearts were a desert!</p>

<p>Instead, they were enchanted ground,
those girlish hearts, carried away by a
sense that Mother Earth did not, after all,
have to go outside her own atmosphere
for her fairy-land,&#8211;her golden crown of
romance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wheel-y-will-y-will-y-il!&#8221;</p>

<p>preluded again the little brown hermit-lover,
with the rufous tail and ruffled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
speckled breast, from an evergreen twig of
the low pine-scrub.</p>

<p>And, once more, the aping response,
the counterfeit thrush-note, came from
some little branch of that goodly green
tree known as the White Birch Group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s doing it? Oh-h! who&#8217;s doing
it&#8211;answering?&#8221; breathed Pemrose Lorry,
feeling thrown into the shade with her
Thunder Bird; which wasn&#8217;t altogether
bad for her, either. &#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s <i>you</i>, is it?
Where&#8217;s the whistle&#8211;the bird-caller&#8217;s
whistle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here. Look!&#8221; A maiden shy as a
hermit-thrush herself, with rufous lights
in her sleek brown hair, and tiny, red-brown
specks flecking the iris of her eyes&#8211;corresponding
to the many freckles upon
her small face, with a luminous quality
added&#8211;opened a volunteering palm.</p>

<p>In its concave hollow, also marbled with
sun-spots, lay the magic whistle, the two
gleaming tin disks about the size of a
fifty-cent piece, joined one upon another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
with an eighth of an inch distance between
them, through whose simple medium
the music in the heart of a fourteen-year-old
girl had so attuned itself to a little of
the melody in the breast of the thrush
as to draw&#8211;actually draw&#8211;the hermit
himself forth on to a rock on the edge of
the thicket, looking eagerly, a trifle doubtfully,
for the raw singer&#8211;the mate, who
had answered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Romeo and Juliet!&#8221; laughed the
Guardian. &#8220;Such a dear little feathered
Romeo, with a beak lined with pure gold&#8211;and
a fairy oboe in his breast! Juliet&#8211;&#8221;
she lightly touched the brown-plumaged
maiden&#8211;&#8220;Juliet answering from her balcony,
this mound!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a parrot Juliet who can coin
such shabby notes to answer him with!&#8221;
breathed the girl, shyly nursing her whistle.
&#8220;No doubt he&#8217;s saying to himself:
&#8216;Shucks! Where&#8217;s that hermit&#8211;or
hermitess&#8211;&#8217;&#8221; merrily, &#8220;&#8216;with the frog in
her throat, or the great, big worm?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>&#8220;Oh! do-o try it again, anyway?&#8221;
pleaded the visitors together. &#8220;It&#8217;s
won-der-ful! We&#8217;ll be as still&#8211;as still
as a nun&#8217;s chapel!&#8221;</p>

<p>And obligingly, once more, the human
thrush lifted up her notes of speckled
sweetness compared to the silver purity
of the strength which answered, the hermit
fluting passionately upon his rock:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;the song complete,</p>
<p>With such a wealth of melody sweet,</p>
<p>As never the organ pipe could blow</p>
<p>And never musician think or know!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Carried beyond himself&#8211;perhaps after
all, he was a lonely hermit&#8211;he actually
hopped from his rock, unalarmed, towards
the firelight, when&#8211;when the concert
was suddenly interrupted by a woodland
gorgon!</p>

<p>By Andrew who, rearing his six feet two
of gaunt, hurlothrumbo length from a
fern-bed, hooking stick in hand, suddenly
lifted from the embers a boiling kettle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>&#8220;Fegs! &#8217;twas like to scald somebody
wi&#8217; its daffy simmer,&#8221; he explained apologetically
to the Guardian, being, in his
capacity of chauffeur, used to camping
emergencies among these picturesque hills&#8211;so
like, in many respects, the wilds of
his Scottish Highlands where the Lady
of the Lake, an original Camp Fire Girl,
shot her skiff across the blue-eyed loch.</p>

<p>&#8220;My certy! but &#8217;twas pretty to see yon
<i>merle</i>, though!&#8221; he murmured, having
restored the kettle to sanity. &#8220;Fine it
minded me, ma&#8217;am, o&#8217; the time when I
was a boy, huntin&#8217; like a nickum for the
nests o&#8217; mavis an&#8217; merle&#8211;blackbird an&#8217;
thrush&#8211;when I&#8217;d rise &#8216;wi&#8217; lark an&#8217;
light!&#8217; Fegs!&#8221; Scotch humor ripping
chauffeur silence, &#8220;yon was a thing to
make a sober body young again; a while
agone I don&#8217;t know but I was feelin&#8217; like
the last o&#8217; pea-time; an&#8217;&#8211;an&#8217;, noo, I&#8217;m
a green pea again,... or I would be but
for the one sair memory,&#8221; added Andrew,
the true-penny, under his breath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>&#8220;Yes&#8211;yes, and you had to go jumping
around like a parched pea, and frightening
the beautiful merle, the thrush, away!&#8221;
complained Una, aggrieved. &#8220;Oh! how
did you ever learn to mimic its call, at
all?&#8221; she cried, catching at the wrist
of the human merle, now very practically
engaged in toasting bacon-strips on the
end of a stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother taught me; my only
brother, Stud&#8211;Studley&#8211;Studart they
nickname him in camp&#8211;I don&#8217;t know
why,&#8221; was the fluttering response.</p>

<p>&#8220;A corruption of Stoutheart, I should
say!&#8221; supplied the Guardian, now
busily frying flapjacks. &#8220;Of all the Boy
Scouts in my husband&#8217;s troop, he&#8217;s the
lion-heart,&#8221; laughingly. &#8220;So I understand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, oh! yes, but he&#8217;s so-o nice, with
it,&#8221; cooed the merle&#8217;s brown-eyed &#8220;mate.&#8221;
&#8220;He has never&#8211;oh! never&#8211;squeezed
me out of anything, just because I was
a girl; always said that two&#8211;two&#8211;could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
hunt together and make good headway!&#8221;
softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so they can: and so they will,
when it comes to the grandest quest of all,
the hunt for truth and justice at the polls,
voting side by side! Girls! Dear&#8211;girls!&#8221;
The eyes of Tanpa, the Guardian, were
ablaze now with more than the firelight&#8217;s
glow, as she tossed her browned cakes on
to a platter. &#8220;<i>Dear</i> girls! In the new,
the wider future before us&#8211;soon to confront
all of you&#8211;let us bring to it our
Camp Fire hall-mark: the hall-mark of
the woods: purity of the Pinnacle&#8217;s breath,
the &#8216;pep&#8217; of the outdoor dawn&#8211;tenderness
of the twilight, when we feel that
God is near!... And now&#8211;and now!
let us sing our grace, not for this food
alone, but for the new manna which has
fallen for us&#8211;the glorious manna of
opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we have earned the right to eat this
bread, happy are we, but if unmerited Thy
blessings come, may we more faithful be!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>On wings of faith the moved chant
floated forth, led by the girl-thrush in a
sweet soprano, supported by the sonorous
roll of the Pinnacle organ, the murmuring
pine trees; and the voices of the
slender tree choir, the slim, white-tunicked
boy-birches, bore it aloft&#8211;aloft to
Heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not only gifted as a &#8216;merle&#8217;,
you sing as a girl, too!&#8221; said Pemrose presently,
nestling nearer to the maiden with
the whistle in her green breast-pocket.
&#8220;You must love birds very much in
order to imitate a thrush-song like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! my ceremonial name, as a Camp
Fire Girl, signifies a little brown bird of
the woods; so I thought it was &#8216;up to
me&#8217; to learn to converse with my kind!&#8221;
was the half-shy, half-spicy answer. &#8220;My
brother Stud and I have no end of fun,
now in the early summer when the birds
have just arrived, and are mating, calling
them around our camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8211;here, let me explain that we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
have a sort of Community camp for boys
and girls about three miles from here,
on the wooded shores of The Bowl, that
lovely, egg-shaped lake among the hills,&#8221;
put in Tanpa, an air-drawn picture in her
glowing tones. &#8220;There are two big bungalows,
a couple of hundred yards apart,
one for the Troop, one for the Group!
Of course, we can&#8217;t occupy them all the
time, at present, not until school is closed,
but we constantly go out there over night&#8211;to
watch the summer coming&#8211;and
for week-ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! the lake and the woods around
it are more wonderful now than at any
other season of the year,&#8221; put in one of
the older girls, an Assistant-Guardian.
&#8220;And we can always keep warm, you
know, even if there is a cold spell in May,
because the boys chop wood for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and we do their mending; oh!
and quite often the shoe pinches&#8211;the
stocking, I mean&#8211;when the holes are
just haggles!&#8221; The eyebrows of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
fair-haired, pretty girl of fifteen were ruefully
arched, over eyes of merriment. &#8220;But
we do&#8211;do have such fun at our Get
Togethers&#8211;our picnics and parties,&#8221; went
on she, whose ceremonial name was Aponi
the Butterfly of the mountain group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hur-ra-ah! There are two such Get
Togethers coming off quite soon now&#8211;one
the day after to-morrow&#8211;Saturday&#8211;a
picnic at Snowbird Cave, to explore
some other caves afterwards upon
the further side of the river, the blue
Housatonic.&#8221;</p>

<p>This contribution came, piecemeal, from
several feasting mouths together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! the Housatonic&#8211;blue&#8211;Hous-a-tonic!&#8221;
Pemrose bent demurely over
her flapjack and cocoa, curling her toes
under her as she recalled her view of it
from the Devil&#8217;s Chair. &#8220;And what about
the second Get Together&#8211;when is that
to be?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A week from Saturday: <i>Jubilate!</i> It&#8217;s
our anniversary day as a White Birch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
Group when we hold a sort of carnival in
he afternoon in honor&#8211;in honor of the
de-ar birch trees just bursting into leaf.&#8221;
Aponi fluttered like green tree-hair, herself.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s to be followed&#8211;whoopee!&#8211;by
a party: a real, full-blown June
dance in the evening&#8211;to which all
the boys are invited. And&#8211;and,
maybe, some girls not of our Groups will
find an invitation tucked into their stockings,
too,&#8221; slily. &#8220;But for the picnic this
week the Boy Scouts are hosts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess, if they knew there were two
strange girls in camp&#8211;such girls&#8211;they&#8217;d
scuttle to &#8216;come across&#8217; with an
invitation, too!&#8221; laughed the one slangy
member inseparable from every group,
whose talk is the long stitch in the thread
of conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they would? Oh! I
don&#8217;t know about that. Boys are such&#8211;such
griffins, sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wormwood was in the eye of Pemrose,
pointing the accusation, a new and gloomy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
pessimism born of the Devil&#8217;s Chair and
Jack at a Pinch.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ours</i> aren&#8217;t!&#8221; It was the voice of the
little girl-thrush lifted in blue-jay belligerence
now. &#8220;Our boys aren&#8217;t queer fish&#8211;not
a bit!&#8221; rising to hot defense of Stud,
the Stoutheart, who even in callow youth,
was of opinion that Life in every phase
was a game for two&#8211;in which two, of
differing sexes, could hunt together and
make good headway.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, they do love to get off jokes
on each other&#8211;and occasionally on us,&#8221;
went on Jessie, the brown-haired merle in
maiden form. &#8220;They have a society of
older boys in their camp called the Henkyl
Hunters&#8217; Brigade. My brother Stud&#8211;he&#8217;s
a patrol leader&#8211;belongs to it. And they
go on the war-path occasionally&#8211;and
publish a bulletin about their doings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a henkyl?&#8221; Una&#8217;s mouth was
wide open; upon its gusty breath rode
horned toads and plated lizards, in imaginary
solution.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;A henkyl! Oh! if you ask <i>them</i>,
they say it&#8217;s a freak of an animal that they
hunt up and down in the woods, trying to
get its scalp, or&#8211;or catch it alive. Which
they seldom or never do!&#8221; Jessie&#8217;s eyes
sparkled. &#8220;Stud says a whole &#8216;henkyl&#8217;
is hard to capture; it&#8217;s so sure to shed its
horns or its teeth just as you pounce
upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pem was staring intently at the speaker,
her black brows drawn together over eyes
as speculatively blue as ever they had been
in Toandoah&#8217;s laboratory when grasping,
or trying to, grave problems of the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I know. I know!&#8221; she cried
suddenly, the blue breaking up in the
firelight into a harlequin patchwork of
merry gleams. &#8220;A henkyl! Why-y! it&#8217;s
a joke. A joke that they&#8217;re forever chasing
up and down, trying to get a laugh against
somebody,&#8211;that absurd brigade!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Companionship with a Thunder Bird
has sharpened your wits,&#8221; smiled the Guardian.
&#8220;A practical joke it is, that most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
elusive thing to pull off whole, point and
all, with the laugh entirely on one side!
Well! we mustn&#8217;t give them any occasion
to turn the chase against us, air their wit
in our direction, by failing in our demonstration
presently&#8211;the signaling practice
to which we challenged them; eh,
Tomoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221; A sixteen-year-old girl,
gray-eyed, vibrant with energy, mobile
as the Lightning, the mettlesome Lightning,
from which she took her Camp
Fire name, spoke up spiritedly. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to flash a message right across the
valley, over to old Round-top, that sleepy,
dark mountain, a couple of miles away,
just as soon as the daylight is all faded
out,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho! That&#8217;s what the Guardian
meant when she spoke of showing us
something&#8211;a display&#8211;with red fire,
eh?&#8221; gasped Pemrose. &#8220;How are you
going to signal&#8211;with what code?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morse code&#8211;and a good, fat two-foot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
pine-knot, oozing with resin!&#8221; smiled
the Lightning, vivid with inspiration.
&#8220;How&#8211;how about sending over this
message: &#8216;Two strange girls in camp;
you ought to meet them&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovely! That will hit the mark!&#8221;
came the appreciative chorus, to the song
of logs. &#8220;Then&#8211;then you&#8217;ll see old
Round-top wake up, quick&#8217;s a wink and
&#8216;come across&#8217; with an invitation&#8211;an invitation
to that banner picnic the day
after to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>Old Round-top</span></span></h2>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;C. F. G.! C. F. G.!</p>
<p>We are the Camp Fire C. F. G.!</p>
<p>Oh! none with us can compare,</p>
<p>For we looked over</p>
<p>And picked the clover,</p>
<p>And the World&#8217;s lit up</p>
<p>With our Camp Fires everywhere!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;And, fegs! wi&#8217; an aging, sober body
like mysel&#8217;, if he isn&#8217;t a-picking o&#8217; the
clover blossoms, he&#8217;s a-smelling o&#8217; them
the night,&#8221; softly soliloquized Andrew,
the chauffeur, as he listened to that halcyon
song around the Pinnacle blaze&#8211;feeling
barred out of Clover Land himself, as
he lay among the ferns, because of the
&#8220;one sair memory&#8221;, the whiff of heather
ever and anon wafted to his nostrils, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
it seemed, from the grave of a fifteen-year-old
lassie away back in Scotland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum-m! if &#8217;tweren&#8217;t for that, I could
maist fling out an&#8217; dance the &#8216;Rigs o&#8217; Barley&#8217;
a-watching o&#8217; those happy lasses,&#8221; he
whimsically confessed in the ear of a king
fern. &#8220;I could, for sure, same&#8217;s we used to
dance it in the glen around a bonfire!&#8221;</p>

<p>But if the heather in his heart, reinforcing
chauffeur primness, checked even
the first lashing kick of a Highland Fling,
it did not restrain him, that grave Church
Elder, from taking part later in something
fully as giddy; a wild and storming
torchlight procession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now! what we need, girls, is a good
r-rich pine-knot, with a juicy, resinous
knot in it, that will burn ten minutes,
anyway, for signaling purposes,&#8221; said
Tomoke, the personified Lightning, as the
&#8220;C. F. G.&#8221; proclamation over, the magic
moment came for the flashing of the light
of this particular camp fire in speaking
fire from mountain to mountain&#8211;across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
the mile and a half of intervening valley.
That inflammable knot was not hard to
find. Split with the toy axe which the
girl who had won an honor bead for signaling
carried at her belt&#8211;a modern Maid
Marion, at home in all woodcraft&#8211;it
blazed, transplendent, a foot-long flambeau,
searching the Pinnacle&#8217;s darkest
nooks, winning sleepy birds from their
slumbers, calling upon them to follow
too, as Tomoke, nimble of foot as her
aÃ«rial namesake, presently dashed up the
hill, with it held high!</p>

<p>Brilliant as a starshell&#8211;where near-by
objects were concerned&#8211;it counted the
needles upon the little, awed pine trees.
It painted the wild excitement upon leaping
girls&#8217; faces, lit dancing Jack-o&#8217;-lanterns
in their eyes as, scrambling, they followed
the light-shod leader&#8211;gold-slippered
by the torch&#8211;in a breathless
tumble-up over rock and needled carpet,
amid scandalized bough and shamefaced
crag and little, blinking torrent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>It turned to nocturnal dewdrops the
bright eyes of the birds,&#8211;scandalized,
too, yet resolved, at all costs, to come in
on the fun!</p>

<p>Robins, flame-breasted in the glow, a
black-throated green warbler&#8211;blossom of
the night&#8211;a purple grackle, its boat-tail
stiff as a fan-shaped rudder, and,
&#8220;leggeddy-last,&#8221; a cawing crow, they
circled on low wing after the brilliant
torch,&#8211;all pecking at the wonder in the
air!</p>

<p>It caught the whooping amazement on
Andrew&#8217;s smooth-shaven upper lip, shimmering
through a veil of anxiety lest,
somewhere, there might be another
&#8220;Deev&#8217;s Chair&#8221; around, or a madcap
lassie to sit in it, as, with an irresistible
&#8220;Hoot mon!&#8221; he brought up the rear
of the fantastic revel; the rush of green-clad
maidens, the elfin tassels of their
Tam-o&#8217;-shanters waving, and of demented
birds for the Pinnacle&#8217;s tallest crag.</p>

<p>Poised upon that gray rock-shelf, high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
above the ground, her slight face with the
shining eyes, framed in the radiant torch-light
as in a golden miniature, the signaler&#8217;s
right arm held the blazing knot with its
ragged, foot-long flame at arm&#8217;s length
above her head, then described a brief
quarter circle to the left with it, quick,
snappy&#8211;once, twice&#8211;the arm being
extended on a level with the young shoulder
so slim, so stiffened!</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8211;See! That stands for I: two
dots! I, three times repeated, gives the
call,&#8221; breathed the Guardian at Pem&#8217;s
elbow, her mature face a gold-set miniature
of excitement, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;oh! I wonder if they&#8217;ll &#8216;get
us&#8217;, those boys&#8211;those joking Henkyl
Hunters?&#8221; The throbbing question was
on every girlish lip. Eyes burned, like
the torch, across the valley.</p>

<p>The mountains were falling asleep in
their night-caps of mist.</p>

<p>But suddenly one of them, far away, grim
and dim, lifted an eyelid&#8211;and responded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>The drowsy valley caught its breath&#8211;as
old Round-top winked back.</p>

<p>Caught its breath with many a waking
scintilla of light in the pointed flash of
pool and stream!</p>

<p>A momentary, broken arc, a shattered
rainbow dividing the flood of dusk above
from the gulf of darkness below; and
then&#8211;and then the triumphant cry in
each gasping throat:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got us! They see us! Now&#8211;now
for the message: &#8216;Two strange
girls with us. You....&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But there the Lightning&#8217;s lore suddenly
gave out, her signaling memory, as the
news was vivaciously transmitted by
staccato dot and lengthier dash, the latter
being the same quarter-circle once described
in a single movement to the right.</p>

<p>Over the valley the message was hung
up. It was hung up in Pem&#8217;s heart, too,&#8211;and
the honor, the fair grace, of boyhood
with it.</p>

<p>If old Round-top unhesitatingly played
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
up, &#8220;came across&#8221; with an invitation&#8211;an
invitation to that alluring Get Together
at the winter palace of the Snowbirds,
then she would feel that a nickum&#8217;s
rudeness was atoned for&#8211;and Jack at
a Pinch might go his graceless road, never
to prove a friend in need to her again&#8211;not
if she knew it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Invite them to the picnic ... and
don&#8217;t forget the cocoa!&#8221;</p>

<p>The valley fairly bristled with the
promptness of it&#8211;the skilled directness
of the message, so rapidly, so spontaneously
given that the poised Lightning
on the crag was hard-pressed to keep up
with the meaning&#8211;to read the handwriting
of fire and give the interpretation
thereof.</p>

<p>Old Round-top had seized the shining
hour. The Henkyl Hunters were no
&#8220;chuffs&#8221;, no conundrums, with the strange
riddle of incivility up a sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Invite them to the picnic&#8211;and don&#8217;t
forget the cocoa!&#8217;&#8221; Tanpa laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
&#8220;Just like them! We did promise to
lay in a fresh supply of sundries, as we
pass through the town to-night&#8211;if there&#8217;s
still a store left open. And that reminds
me, girlies, that it&#8217;s getting late. We have
no right to keep the birds out of bed any
longer, demoralizing the feathered world.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Lightning had recovered its
morale, its memory, prompted by a Morse
code-card excitedly snatched from a green
breast pocket and explored by the light
of the dwindling torch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Invite&#8211;your&#8211;friends&#8211;to&#8211;our&#8211;d-a-n-c-e,&#8221;
slowly spelled out Tomoke,
giving back diamond for diamond.</p>

<p>She was beginning upon the word &#8220;A-ll&#8221;,
but the pine-knot winked itself out in a
dazzlement on &#8220;dance,&#8221;&#8211;in an effulgence
of sparks that fell like golden rain upon
the hearts of the visitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it&#8211;will it be an outdoor affair&#8211;a
piazza dance?&#8221; gasped Una.
&#8220;Oh-h! I do love.... Now! Andrew!&#8221;
She broke off suddenly at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
chauffeur&#8217;s declaration that it was
&#8220;magerful&#8221; show, &#8220;yon fire-talk&#8221;, that
he never expected to see the like carried
on by &#8220;tids o&#8217; lassies&#8221;, but that it really
wasn&#8217;t in him to stand there any longer
rolling his eyes over it, like a duck in
thunder. &#8220;Now, Andrew!&#8221; reasoned his
employer&#8217;s young daughter. &#8220;You know
that you&#8217;ve driven my father and mother,
and Professor Lorry, too, to a dinner-party,
where the professor is to give a
talk about the Thunder Bird&#8211;and oh!
may its fiery tale be a long one to-night&#8211;you
won&#8217;t have to fetch them home
for another two hours yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoot! It&#8217;s saft as peppermint. I am
wi&#8217; ye, Miss Una, but it&#8217;s time for all
lassies to gang home,&#8221; returned the other
with paternal insistence, lifting his cap
in questioning appeal to the Guardian.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right, dear. <i>We</i> must be starting
for the home camp, too&#8211;just as
soon as we&#8217;ve seen that our fire is
thoroughly extinguished,&#8221; said Tanpa.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
&#8220;Our paths don&#8217;t lie in the same direction,
but we hope they often will in future.
As to the dance, it will be a piazza affair,
if the evening is fine&#8211;the festive wind-up
of an exciting day, our White Birch
anniversary which we celebrate with rites
and symbolic dancing, in honor of our
patron, our woodland lady, the leafing
birch tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How lovely; per-fect-ly love-ly!&#8221; flowed
from the visitors, both, in a silvery ripple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! how about your spending a
few days in camp with us then&#8211;at our
camp on the Bowl&#8211;if your elders are
willing?&#8221; went on the gracious grown-up
woman, with warmth as golden as the
sunburst on her breast. &#8220;We&#8217;ll let Pemrose
Lorry plant the tallest birch sapling
in honor of the Thunder Bird. Long&#8211;long
before it&#8217;s a full-grown tree, let us
hope, the Bird will have made its great
migration, crossing, not a continent, but
space! And now, dears, <i>au revoir</i>! to
meet again at Snowbird Cave.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>Cobweb Weed</span></span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Well!</span> you certainly are the laziest
bunch; you&#8217;d carry a whole bakery in
your knapsacks rather than do any cooking&#8211;especially
if there are girls around.
Lazy as Ludlam&#8217;s dog you are! Next
time&#8211;next time, I&#8217;ll set you to peeling
potatoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the chaffing voice of the Scoutmaster,
Malcolm Seaver, which spoke,
addressing some twenty scouts who were
scattered about the vine-draped entrance
to Snowbird Cave, where, yearly, the
little gray-white junco birds&#8211;otherwise
snow-birds&#8211;fluffy balls, with no heads
to speak of, wintered among the low
hemlocks near the cavern&#8217;s mouth and
fed upon the spicy hemlock bark.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>&#8220;I&#8211;I wonder if you could tell me of
what breed Ludlam&#8217;s dog was, sir? If
he could burn up daylight chasing his
tail any better than this crowd can, lolling
around on a picnic, he must be the limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer came with the low, drawling
laugh of Stud Bennett, otherwise
Studart, brother to Jessie, the &#8220;merle&#8217;s&#8221;
calling mate, who was himself playing
fiddle-faddle in the sunshine, after a four-mile
hike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Well, <i>I&#8217;m</i> off to locate a
spring&#8211;where&#8217;s the blue bucket? When
I get back you&#8217;ll <i>have</i> to turn to, you
dummies, build a fire and unpack the commissariat&#8211;otherwise
rolls by the dozen. The &#8216;duff&#8217; and Frankforts are in
the &#8216;Baby&#8217;, I guess.&#8221; The Scoutmaster
shot a glance at a big, brown duffle bag
reposing on a mound, capable of containing
ten bags of rations, each pertaining
to individual scouts on a long hike, yet
hardly sufficient to transport the &#8220;cates&#8221;,
the luncheon for eighteen Camp Fire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
Girls and twenty scouts, plus a couple of
invited guests, on a Together picnic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any boys and girls who are
dying to come with me, to prospect for
water?&#8221; he put forth alluringly, to the
rhythmic swing of the big water bucket
in his right hand, painted bright blue.</p>

<p>There was an instant volunteering flutter
among certain green-clad girls and lads in
khaki, breezing up from the grass where
they had languished; others held back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather explore the cave&#8211;I love
creepy caves&#8211;and we haven&#8217;t been half
through it yet,&#8221; said Pemrose Lorry.</p>

<p>Forthwith Stud, the Henkyl Hunter,
decided that cave-exploiting was the pastime
for him; there was rarely a younger
boy&#8211;Studart was barely fifteen&#8211;who
did not become the captive knight of
this older girl with the sky in her eyes
under jet-black lashes!</p>

<p>Jessie, sister of Stoutheart, she of the
thrush-song in her heart, wanted to be
near to the girl who was mate to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
Thunder Bird, too; and others were drawn by
the same abstract birdlime&#8211;or else the
bat-stirred cave had lures.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8211;there&#8217;s a secret lobby in it,&#8221;
said Stud, &#8220;a dark, rocky passage leading
off from that queer black, three-cornered
fissure in the right wall, ten feet
from the ground&#8211;I guess nobody has
ever explored it; nobody has cracked the
nut of what&#8217;s behind that triangular
crevice, so high up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come&#8211;come; that sounds exciting,
very exciting!&#8221; remarked Tanpa, the Guardian,
remaining behind too, as chaperon.</p>

<p>But her husband wheeled upon his jog-trot
off after water, swinging his galvanized
iron bucket after a manner to
give the air the blues.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I wouldn&#8217;t try to crack the
nut, solve the riddle, of what&#8217;s behind
that queer-shaped crevice, Stud,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s black&#8211;black as a tinker&#8217;s pot
in there. You wouldn&#8217;t know what you
were heading into!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>&#8220;Aw, gammon! I wouldn&#8217;t be afraid
to tackle that fissure&#8211;find out what&#8217;s
back of it&#8211;although I&#8217;m not a Tin
Scout&#8211;ha! ha!&#8211;out with the whole
toyshop to-day; all my monkey trappings,&#8221;
exploded a rough voice suddenly
from among a trio of clownish-looking
boys who hovered, vulture-like, on the
edge of the picnic ground, transfixing with
a sanguinary eye the Baby, whose soft
heart was of blueberry &#8220;duff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I tell you what&#8217;s more, if I were
to climb up an&#8217; in there, I&#8217;d trust to my
own &#8216;bean&#8217; and a few matches, &#8217;thout
any gimcracks,&#8221; craked the boastful voice
further, the special gewgaw on which the
braggart fixed his eye, at the moment,
being the little Baldwin safety lamp, four
inches high, which Stud was just lighting,
attached to the front of his olive-green
scout hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tr-rust to your own &#8216;bean&#8217;&#8211;your
own head&#8211;an&#8217; what&#8217;s inside it! Well!
I&#8217;ll admit it&#8217;s fiery enough,&#8221; flouted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
Henkyl Hunter, piqued even in the presence
of girls into giving back tit for tat.
&#8220;But you&#8217;re carrying too many eggs in
one basket, let me tell you, and you&#8217;re
likely enough to take a leap in the dark
an&#8217; smash &#8217;em all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Am I now,&#8221; snarled the other,
resenting the implication that his brick-red
head was a brash basket into which
to pack all his chances of safety, such as
were not anchored to the poor stay of a
few fickle matches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I now-ow?&#8221; he chortled, very
red in the face&#8211;and tongue-tied&#8211;as
he shadowed the picnic party through
the cave.</p>

<p>At his wits&#8217; end for a verbal retort, he
presently proceeded, after the manner of
his kind, to throw a stone in his own
garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here! you kids, if you&#8217;ll let me
stand on your shoulders, you two, I&#8217;ll
give those Tin Scouts an eye-opener,&#8221;
he said, retaliating after a manner to hurt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
only himself, as he addressed the two
younger boys with him, his eyes cast up
to that mysterious fissure, outlined, a
rocky tripod, above his head, of which
the Scoutmaster had remarked that all
behind it was black as a tinker&#8217;s pot.</p>

<p>Into that ebony pot, forthwith, climbing
by the willing step-ladder of his companions&#8217;
bodies, Ruddy, the rashling, presently
thrust his head&#8211;that flaming head
with all his chances in it!</p>

<p>His body followed, finding entrance
through the crevice amidships, so to speak,
where it broadened out to some three
feet across from the tapering point of
the lowest corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-h! look at him. Do look at
him!&#8221; panted the girls, held up in their
search for pale-faced cave flowers and
strange fungi by the &#8220;derring-do&#8221; act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious! some of you scouts ought
to stop him&#8211;re-al-ly ought to stop him,&#8221;
shrilled Jessie, catching her breath at
the shock of darkness visible in the yawning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
fissure&#8217;s mouth, where the brief flicker
of a match now chased bogies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! We can&#8217;t head him off,
Jess.&#8221; Her brother disclaimed responsibility
with a shrug&#8211;while the little lamp
winked sarcastically from his hatbrim&#8211;but
in the heedful tone of the boy who
had been trained to feel&#8211;as Toandoah
did with his little petticoated pal&#8211;that
Life was a game in which two could hunt
together, even upon the trail of a Thunder
Bird, and make good headway. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t turn him back!&#8221; Stud shrugged
his khaki shoulders. &#8220;But he&#8217;ll strike
a blind bargain in there. Ha! There
goes another &#8216;niggling&#8217; match!&#8221;</p>

<p>A frippery flame, indeed, its reflection
flickered a moment, a gold tooth in the
fissure&#8217;s grinning mouth&#8211;darkness followed!</p>

<p>Two or three of the boy scouts&#8211;those
who did not, like Stud, show incredulity,
sarcasm gleaming, hawk-eyed, from a
ruby lamp hooked to a hatband, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
from a level eye beneath it&#8211;held their
breath, dazzled; for the moment beaten
at their own brave game of exploring.</p>

<p>So did the girl who had been piqued
and dared into sitting in the Devil&#8217;s Chair&#8211;with
a sheer abyss beneath her!</p>

<p>Again did her wide-open, staring eyes,
under their black lashes, sport a Blue
Peter, the flag of adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he&#8217;s plucky, anyhow. I wonder
what he&#8217;ll find in there?&#8221; her palms
were laid together upon a spicy filling of
excitement. &#8220;He really is daring&#8211;awfully
daring, you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Courage cobweb-weed!&#8221; muttered
Stud laconically. &#8220;Well&#8211;well,
he&#8217;ll have tears in his eyes before I go
after him!&#8221;</p>

<p>And&#8211;with that&#8211;there was the
rasp of a third &#8220;niggling&#8221; match, faintly-heard,
far in, a momentary reflection,
a tiny glance-coal, in the fissure&#8217;s leering
mouth! And&#8211;and, following that, a shriek!</p>

<p>A shriek, headlong, sinking and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
pitching&#8211;dying like a falling star, as if some
clutch were stifling it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hea-vens!&#8221; The girls, blanching,
shrank against the opposite cave-wall,
which shuddered behind them.</p>

<p>A bat, flying low, a winged Fear,
brushed Tanpa&#8217;s cheek, as she stood, transfixed,&#8211;and
her cry was almost as hysterical
as theirs.</p>

<p>In the blackness of that Tinker&#8217;s Pot
behind the looming fissure, were there
other things&#8211;other things besides a boy,
a broken braggart of a boy?</p>

<p>Was Death in the pot with him? Had
he sipped of its mystery&#8211;only to perish?
Death&#8211;it seemed a raving possibility&#8211;in
the shape of some wild animal, perhaps&#8211;a
live, a clutching claw!</p>

<p>Tales were always current among the
mountains, trappers&#8217; tales&#8211;and most of
them airy &#8220;traveler&#8217;s yarns&#8221;, too&#8211;of
strange tracks seen in lonely spots, of
lynx and bobcat; and even of the young
and roving panther.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>To be sure, a three-cornered tunnel, the
second floor back of a lofty cave, would be
the last place to look for such an ambush,
unless there was some fly-trap opening to
it from above. But there might be!</p>

<p>Boys and girls, both, their blood flamed
upon the fear, then froze&#8211;until the
silence, the bat-churned cave silence, was
hung with icicles above them.</p>

<p>Then, once more, it was ripped from
on top by that perishing shriek&#8211;passing
strange, remote&#8211;but now it was
as if the fissure&#8217;s three-cornered mouth
filled with it, faintly gibbered the one
word: &#8220;C-caught!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;<i>Caught!</i>&#8217; Oh! Stud, you warned
him; it&#8217;s his own doing. Let those other
two boys&#8211;his friends&#8211;climb up to him!
Well&#8211;if you feel&#8211;you&#8211;must?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessie&#8217;s cry gibbered in agony in her
throat, too, liquid as the thrush-tone in
terror for its mate. But it struck a high
note at the end.</p>

<p>For Stud&#8217;s hand was groping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
mechanically for the bright little lamp above his
forehead, as if for inspiration, his left
for the lariat at his waist, in defiance
of his threat that the desperado in the
&#8220;pot&#8221; might have tears in his eyes before
he would help him.</p>

<p>But there was something worse than
cave-tears in question now&#8211;of that
Studart felt sure.</p>

<p>And Pem, watching,&#8211;Jessie, too&#8211;caught
from an entering shaft of day-light
which shivered as if aghast, the
reflection of the tightening glow upon
his young face&#8211;the waggish features of
the Henkyl Hunter!</p>

<p>And she recognized it, by the feeling
of her stiff, cold cheeks, as she clapped
her hands to them&#8211;did Toandoah&#8217;s
little chum&#8211;for the glow which had
electrified her own when she fought her
way out of a swamped Pullman, saving
her friend, driving it into the teeth of the
flood, and of the World, too, that neither
her father&#8217;s honor, nor his invention&#8211;nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
anything he ever turned out&#8211;was a
Quaker gun; letting fly with it faintly
at a rescuing youth, too, when she bade
him &#8220;take Una first.&#8221;</p>

<p>For by that glow as by an altar-lamp, in
whose gleam she had worshiped before
she saw as the strong boy&#8217;s hand went
automatically to his equipment that lamp
and lariat were nothing&#8211;nothing&#8211;&#8220;without
the heart of a Scout!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>Stoutheart</span></span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>W-wedged!</span>... Wedged!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now&#8211;now it was another word which
jabbered faintly in the dark fissure&#8217;s mouth!
A girl caught it&#8211;or thought she did.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Wedged!</i>&#8221; she echoed wildly. &#8220;Caught!
Oh, maybe&#8211;maybe&#8211;there&#8217;s nothing in
there but Ruddy himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe&#8211;so!&#8221; Stud panted heavily
while, across an inner, gaping hollow, the
next words took a giant stride to his lips:
&#8220;Anyhow&#8211;I&#8217;m going up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;Studley!&#8221; But beyond this one
faint cry, Jessie, stanch little partner,&#8211;the
girl behind the lines,&#8211;said no more to
hinder him now, as she watched the scout
detach his little lamp from his hatbrim
and hook it on to his khaki breast.</p>

<p>With it glowing there, a headlight for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
his gallant heart, Stud set himself to climb.
Standing upon the shoulders of two
brother scouts, in his belt a club snatched
from one of them, he reached the lowest
point of the tapering fissure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! There he goes, in spite of his
teeth,&#8221; tremored a younger boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;His teeth aren&#8217;t chattering!&#8221; Pem&#8217;s
eyes&#8211;lightning-blue&#8211;hurled back the
charge.</p>

<p>The denial rang in Stud&#8217;s ears as he
thrust his head into the black opening,
entering, amidships, as the former muddle-headed
explorer had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;That girl&#8217;s a trump&#8211;the girl with
eyes the color of the little &#8216;heal-all&#8217;, that
blue flower we pick up here in May! A
trump! But so&#8217;s little Jess, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus did Stoutheart, a knight of to-day,
pay tribute to the world he left behind him,
when he felt in his exploring knees, now
creeping along the bottom of the Tinker&#8217;s
Pot, that there was a chance of his leaving
it behind forever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what else he <i>could</i> have
done,&#8221; said Tanpa, the Guardian, her
fingers hysterically interlocking. &#8220;Somebody
had to go up; and he&#8217;s the oldest
boy&#8211;a Patrol Leader. But, oh! I wish
my husband were here. Run and meet
him, a couple of you!&#8221; She glanced appealingly
at the scouts. &#8220;Oh! do&#8211;and
hurry him back&#8211;back from the spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Stud had forgotten even his
backers in the feminine hearts below and
was banking all on just one trusty ally&#8211;the
headlight on his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without the light, the little safety
lamp, I couldn&#8217;t do-o it,&#8221; he told himself.
&#8220;Gee! but it is as black in here as Erebus,
a Tinker&#8217;s Pot, indeed&#8211;the blindest passage&#8211;blindest
bargain&#8211;I ever struck!
So&#8211;so sharp underneath, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, difficulty masked was in the
&#8220;bargain&#8221;, yet he crept on over tapering
ridges of rock that now and again buckled
like teeth. But he knew by the parched
sound of his own voice, as he shouted a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
question, that his courage might have ended
in smoke, there and then, if it weren&#8217;t for
the little lamp at his breast.</p>

<p>So rosily it burned now, in here, that its
feeding oil seemed the red blood of his
heart!</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow&#8211;anyhow, with it, I&#8217;ll be
able to see which way the cat jumps!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, Stoutheart more tightly gripped the
club; the last words might prove more
than mere figure of speech.</p>

<p>From ahead came strange, gurgling,
choking sounds, rising from somewhere&#8211;growing
weaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8211;where are you, Ruddy?
Answer! R-rap&#8211;rap out something, if
you can!&#8221; he adjured.</p>

<p>And it was&#8211;truly&#8211;a rapping reply
that reached him; a queer, hollow knocking
at the door of some throat that semed
shutting.</p>

<p>&#8220;My word! What on earth ... what
in thunder&#8217;s got him?&#8221; Stud felt his own
breath blow hot and cold together, but&#8211;this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
crucial moment it came back to
him&#8211;the eyes of a girl out there had
driven it home, with blue lightnings, that
he did not <i>have</i> to defy his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I&#8217;m no quitter,&#8221; he told
the piloting breast-ray, blazing its ruby
trail ahead. &#8220;Well-ll! for the love of
Mike! Well! what do you know about
that?... What have we h-here?&#8221;</p>

<p>In answer to his gasping snort, as he
gaped and gasped there in the darkness,
the little safety lamp told him what it
made of it&#8211;of the staggering sight&#8211;it
made a pair of big feet in rough cowhide
boots tightly wedged by the ankles in a
buckling switch of rock where two sharp,
narrow ridges that formed the bottom
of the Tinker&#8217;s Pot dovetailed into each
other,&#8211;after the manner of rails at a
switch.</p>

<p>Ruddy, the slipslop explorer, had gone
in heels over head, so to speak. He was
hanging by the heels now. Nothing visible
of him but those pinioned feet!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>&#8220;<i>Hea-vens!</i> he did strike a blind bargain.
S-such a snag! The passage ends here. A
drop! A&#8211;blank&#8211;fall of rock! Gee-ee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dank&#8211;dank as cave-tears now was the
moisture upon Stud&#8217;s forehead. For the
first time his teeth almost chattered. What
would he see when he held the lamp over
the edge of the Tinker&#8217;s Pot into the
horror of that empty space beyond where
the passage broadened into blankness and
the rock shelved sharply down? A dead
boy? Or one so far gone from hanging
that he could not be rescued?</p>

<p>At the first sight of those wedged feet
he had felt inclined to laugh. Now he was
laughing at the wrong side of his mouth,
as he peeped over the brink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-h! the rock <i>isn&#8217;t</i> perpendicular;
it slants down, though, pretty sharply&#8211;down
into an inner cave&#8211;by gracious!
And Ruddy, the way he&#8217;s hanging his
nose, is within an inch or two o&#8217; the floor
of that other cave!... And, yet, he&#8217;s
helpless! Helpless as if he had a halter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
round his neck! Oh-h! if some of the other
fellows were here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Stud did not seem to be quite alone;
he was one and a half; for the hearts of
two girls were pendent from <i>his</i> neck;
outside he knew they were backing him,&#8211;praying
for him.</p>

<p>Also, that frenzied gurgle from the victim&#8217;s
throat, his choking cry as the light
struck him, the squirming body and up-rolling
eyes told the boy scout that he was
just in time; although the foam was
pink upon Ruddy&#8217;s lips and his congested
head was a fire-ball, indeed,&#8211;that brash
head with all his chances in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;No Loyal Scout gives place to doubt,</p>
<p>But action quick he shows!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The song, his own, the original march-song
of his troop, sang itself through Stud&#8217;s
brain, seethed in the low whistle upon his
lips, as, guided by his ruby breast-eye,
he slid down into that strange and secret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
dungeon in which the black passage ended
and, thrusting his sturdy shoulders under
the pendent body of the victim whose
convulsed hands clutched vainly at the
bare slab, raised it so that the choking boy
could breathe freely again&#8211;and in due
time shake off the dizziness of his awful
plight, hung up by the heels by the rock
itself.</p>

<p>But not until the Scoutmaster came to
his patrol leader&#8217;s assistance could those
pinioned feet be really freed and their
owner brought to daylight again, not by
a return via the fissure route, but hoisted
in a rope-noose, as Pem had been from the
Devil&#8217;s Chair, through a grass-covered
opening discoverable in the roof of that
inner cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness! after all, he wasn&#8217;t so much
more foolish&#8211;headstrong&#8211;than I was.
But Una! Una! If you ever-r tell them!&#8221;
Thus did the maiden of the chowchow name
spill her spice into her friend&#8217;s ear,&#8211;burning
spice, for, privately, she was shocked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
at seeing her own folly, parodied, vulgarized,
as it were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I should say! He was hanging
between hawk and buzzard&#8211;if ever a
fellow was,&#8221; happened to be Stud&#8217;s moved
comment as, clinging to that lowered rope,
he was hoisted, too, through that covert
opening, the loyal little lamp upon his
breast paling now into a penny candle
held towards the sun.</p>

<p>But the rescuer&#8217;s halo did not pale.</p>

<p>It burnished the picnic luncheon which
followed, encircling, rainbow-like, little Jessie
who basked in it more than did the
rebellious hero, pelted with wild flowers by
the girls&#8211;as symbolic of other bouquets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! let up&#8211;let up&#8211;will you?
Those big fellows will take me for the
&#8216;goat&#8217;&#8211;somebody&#8217;s &#8216;goat&#8217;!&#8221; protested
Stud helplessly, striving to direct attention
from himself by training it upon a straggling
group of distant youths, really too far off
to take stock of what was going on among
the merry picnic party.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>But Pemrose was taking stock of them.
Her widening eyes, her reddening cheeks,
the little piqued shiver that electrified her
chin, told that one figure&#8211;one figure&#8211;called
for recognition; called for it, indeed,
so loudly that it couldn&#8217;t be denied
him.</p>

<p>Every member of that group&#8211;a canoeing
party, a wading party, it was, just
landed from the near-by river, the blue
Housatonic&#8211;was a blaze of color.</p>

<p>But the sturdiest among them was simply
barbaric. The warm sunlight of May
dripped golden from his nickum shoulders,
bronzed to the hue of a statue, bathed his
bare knees and feet, his khaki shorts, the
flame of an apricot jersey, the black and
yellow cap,&#8211;the sheaf of mayflowers within
his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how boys&#8211;big boys&#8211;do revel
in color. A girl&#8211;any girl I ever knew&#8211;is
demure in her taste beside them,&#8221; murmured
the Camp Fire Guardian, with
amused, motherly tolerance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>&#8220;Pshaw! I think it&#8217;s hor-rid. So
flashy!&#8221; snapped Pemrose; Jack at a
Pinch had made gorgeous his incivility and
was parading it before her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, boy! Look at that middle fellow.
He&#8217;d have a grosbeak &#8216;skun a mile&#8217;!&#8221;
gasped Stud, following the direction of her
glance, with a virtuous consciousness of
his own cave-soiled khaki, moderately lit
by merit badge and service stripe.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Grosbeak!&#8217; Oh, but I love grosbeaks!
And all that color&#8211;why! it paints
the landscape,&#8221; came flutteringly from
Aponi, the White Birch Butterfly, least
Priscilla-like in her tastes of the Group,
when she was not in Camp Fire green, or
soft-toned ceremonial dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe &#8217;twill paint the blues in old
Tory Cave, if we run across them there,&#8221;
put in Tomoke, maiden of the flambeau
and the fire-talk. &#8220;They certainly are a
perfect &#8216;scream&#8217;, those big boys,&#8221; her eyes
merrily following that clamor of color
now wending back towards the canoes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>&#8220;Humph! they&#8217;d have to &#8216;go some&#8217; to
leaven the blues of Tory Cave,&#8221; remarked
the Scoutmaster, laughingly addressing
himself to a roll. &#8220;The biggest bonfire on
earth wouldn&#8217;t half dry the cave-tears
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the den of the Doleful
Dumps&#8211;their diggings!&#8221; laughed a
younger scout, flourishing aloft a mess-mug,
the gray of his rolling eyes. &#8220;Bats&#8211;bats
as big as saucers&#8211;no, soup-plates!
And, far in&#8211;far in&#8211;the sound of running
water, like a weak wind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Running water! Invisible running
water! A&#8211;weak&#8211;wind! Oh-h! do let
us hurry and go on there. We have to
cross the river; haven&#8217;t we?&#8221; The gurgle
of that cloistered brooklet was already in
Pem&#8217;s heart as her dilating gaze spanned
the Housatonic, broad and open, &#8220;warbling&#8221;
amid its soft meadow slopes, as she
had looked upon it from the Devil&#8217;s Chair.
&#8220;But, goody! I hope we <i>won&#8217;t</i> run across
him there&#8211;Jack at a Pinch! Flaunting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
round like a grosbeak!&#8221; She bit the
thought into an olive. &#8220;Stud&#8217;s no grumpy
riddle&#8211;if he is a Stoutheart, like the
other!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Running</span> water! Invisible running
water! The voice behind the scenes
prompting the play,&#8211;the grim play of
bat and rat and reptile in old Tory Cave,
where the rocks wept, the little strolling
sunbeams clapped their hands, and the
great fungi, primrose-skirted, drooped over
a drama never finished!</p>

<p>It was even more romantic than the
girls had hoped for,&#8211;such romance as
clings, cobweb-like, to melancholy.</p>

<p>Like a weak wind, truly, a sad wind
blowing from nowhere, was the purl of that
hidden streamlet whose mystery no man
had penetrated&#8211;nor ever seen its flow&#8211;mournfully
as cave tears it dripped upon
the ears and hearts of the girls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>&#8220;Pshaw! Who cares for weeping rocks,
though they look as if they were bursting
with grief and ready to tear their pale hair&#8211;that
queer growth clinging to them.
Humph! Only crocodile tears, anyhow,
like &#8216;Alice in Wonderland!&#8217;&#8221; cried Ista,
the laughing Eye of the White Birch
Group, whose everyday name was Polly
Leavitt.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>not</i> the tears and it&#8217;s not that
horribly sad lake with the little, blind,
colorless fish in it, that I mind&#8211;it&#8217;s the
Bats!&#8221; screamed Una Grosvenor. &#8220;Oh-h!&#8221;
as the mouse-like head of the cave mammal
and its skinny wing almost brushed her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! They&#8217;re not brick-bats,&#8221; came
reassuringly from one of the boys, as the
Togetherers ranged through the outer part
of that vast Tory Cave&#8211;once the hiding-place
of a political refugee, whose spirit
seemed flitting among them in the filmy
cave-fog which, dank and mournful, clung
about the margin of that strange lake of
fresh water where blind fish played.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>Presumably fed by that cloistered brooklet,
whose cell, far in, in an impenetrable
recess, no human foot had ever trod, the
lakelet had the floor to itself, so to speak,
so that in places scouts with their lamps,
and girls pairing off with their exploring
brothers, one piloting eye between them,
had difficulty in skirting it&#8211;without a
ducking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! a ducking in the dark&#8211;a
cave-bath&#8211;horrible!&#8221; cried Pemrose.
&#8220;Oh, mer-rcy! what&#8211;what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! Only a garter snake&#8211;a pretty
fellow,&#8221; laughed Studley, picking the slim,
striped thing up from a corner of the blind
lake where it was amphibiously basking,
and letting it curl around his khaki arm,
investigating the merit badges of the patrol
leader.</p>

<p>The green and red of the life-saver&#8217;s
embroidered badge, the crossed flags of the
expert signaler, the white plow of the
husbandman, they enlivened the gloom a
wee bit, winking up at the safety lamp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
hooked to his hat-band, as he bent over the
illumined reptile.</p>

<p>But they did not challenge it as did the
flash of an apricot sweater, blood-red in
the ruby lamplight, of a black and yellow
cap, several yellow and black caps, suddenly&#8211;eagerly&#8211;thrust
near.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s big&#8211;big for a garter, isn&#8217;t he,
Buddy?&#8221; remarked a voice that did not
come from the ranks of Togetherers, of
Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls, excitedly
scrutinizing Stud&#8217;s novel armlet.</p>

<p>Neither&#8211;neither was it the voice of the
nickum, so much Pemrose knew, as she
edged coldly a little away,&#8211;a little nearer
to the dim and sighing lake-edge.</p>

<p>Yet he was among them, those gaudy
big boys, whose flare of color merely striped
the cave-dusk, like the dingy markings
upon the snake&#8217;s squirming back.</p>

<p>He actually had his armful of mayflowers,
too, the nickum, not the snake; <i>passÃ«</i>
mayflowers, with the tan of decay on them,
was nursing them carefully, as if they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
part of a long lost heritage into which he
had lately come&#8211;as if he were afraid
to lay them down lest some alien should
snatch them from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look like a &#8216;chuff&#8217;&#8211;a
boor. He looks like a really nice college
boy, one with a hazing imp in his eye
though, lur-rking in that little star&#8211;almost
a squint; so&#8211;so like Una&#8217;s,&#8221;
thought the inventor&#8217;s daughter, familiar
with the student brand of boy. &#8220;Yet
how could he be so uncivil to us, really&#8211;actually&#8211;snub
us, after all he did, too?
Goodness! wouldn&#8217;t I like to get a chance
to snub him?&#8221; It was the Vain Elf
which slept in the shadow of the Wise
Woman in the breast of Pemrose Lorry,
that stored this wish, laid it up, a
vengeful arrow in the blue quiver of her
eyes, now shooting piqued, sidelong glances
at those flaunting big boys. &#8220;Why-y <i>should</i>
we run up against them here? Well!
he&#8217;ll never get a chance to play Jack at a
Pinch&#8211;friend in need&#8211;to me again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
Watch me&#8211;watch me pick my steps!&#8221;
She picked them so at random, at the
moment, moving off, that she came near
slipping in for that eerie ducking, with the
blind fish&#8211;pale as phantoms, swimming
round&#8211;and Stud, flinging the striped
garter away, hurried after her&#8211;Jessie, too!</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! this is a peach of a cave; isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; effervesced the scout sarcastically.
&#8220;Melancholy so blooming thick that you
could almost sup its sorrow with a spoon,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a regular cave of despair.&#8221; The
lonely trill of the feathered hermit was in
Jessie&#8217;s answering note. &#8220;That sad voice
of water, a cascade&#8211;a stream&#8211;far in,
which nobody ever saw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give worlds to see it!&#8221; said Pemrose.</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I!&#8221; Stud&#8217;s voice was pitched
high. &#8220;If it weren&#8217;t for the Scoutmaster....
Tradition says that whoever drinks
of that hidden water will have luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I&#8217;d let somebody else have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
piping times if I were you, Buddy&#8211;if
they depend on a draught from that mysterious
spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, it was the nickum who answered;
the same scintillating tones they were&#8211;how
bully they sounded then&#8211;which had
quoted Shakespeare on &#8220;Something rotten
in the State of Denmark&#8221;, amid other
depressing waters, half hidden, half liberated
by their ice-cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can look out for my own &#8216;piping
times&#8217;&#8211;thank you! And I&#8217;m not going
to buy any pig in a poke&#8211;take any leap
in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s reply was bristling. To a
fifteen-year-old patrol leader, a Henkyl
Hunter, who went up and down upon the
trail of a joke, there was a smack of condescension
about that &#8220;Buddy&#8221;, used twice
by those big boys; perhaps he, too, at
that moment, laid up something against
the youth of the flaming tone and rig.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! hasn&#8217;t he the nerve, butting
in?&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>&#8220;He has&#8211;has all sorts of nerve,&#8221; agreed
Pemrose readily, glancing sideways after
the boy whose courage she knew to be
as high as his colors.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Scoutmaster wouldn&#8217;t hear of
our venturing in so far as to investigate
that running water, anyhow,&#8221; said Studley.
&#8220;My eye! What&#8217;s the rumpus now&#8211;the
kettle o&#8217; fish?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a shriek from one girl&#8211;half-a-dozen
girls. It was a loud hiss, almost a
whistle, from some pallid vegetation near
the lake-edge. It was a black snake rearing
a blue-black head and glittering eye
within three feet of Una Grosvenor, novice
among Camp Fire Girls, whose scream tore
at the very stones of Tory Cave until they
cried out in echo.</p>

<p>It was a dozen green-clad girls scattering
wildly this way and that, olive-green aspen
leaves tossing in a whirlwind, shuffling from
pillar to post&#8211;from rock to darkling rock.</p>

<p>It was&#8211;it was a powerful reptile form,
in armor of jetty scales, trailing its six-foot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
length away, the noise of its mighty tail-blows
against the earth and flying pebbles
calling all the Dumps&#8211;the Doleful Dumps&#8211;out
of the dens where they hid here,
making them take strange and shadowy
shapes, gigantic shapes, of threat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me get out! Oh-h! I want to get
out, away&#8211;anywhere!&#8221; shuddered Una.
&#8220;This is no-o fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! it is&#8211;once you get used to it,&#8221;
laughed Pemrose, who&#8211;together with the
Jack at a Pinch still hovering near&#8211;liked
her excitement warm. &#8220;Look&#8211;<i>look</i> at
him crimp himself along! Ever&#8211;ever see
anything so crooked?&#8221; as the great muscle
in the reptile&#8217;s body contracted and relaxed
upon its hasty retreat. &#8220;When we
girls had our War Garden, a year ago, an
old farmer said we planted our potato rows
so straight that he &#8216;vummed &#8217;twould make
a black snake seasick to cross from one to
the other.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Because he just naturally has to
go ajee!&#8221; laughed her scout knight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
estimating the length of that scaly corkscrew,
if uncoiled, with his eye. &#8220;Pshaw! I&#8217;ve
tamed &#8217;em&#8211;and killed &#8217;em, too,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! a black snake wouldn&#8217;t harm
you, even if he did bite.&#8221; Pem was still
reassuring her friend. &#8220;Did you hear him
whistle?... But&#8211;but what&#8217;s that?&#8221;
It was just half a minute later that she
put the question. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t making that
noise with his tail still; is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at Stud. Under the ruby
eye of the lamp his face&#8211;the face of a
Stoutheart&#8211;had turned suddenly pea-green.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed upon a gleam of
bloated yellow dimly seen, under the lee of
a rock, not very many yards away&#8211;the
venomous, pale yellow of the dropsical
cave fungi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why! it&#8217;s only one of those
horrid, blowzy, mushroom things. But
<i>what&#8217;s</i> the noise&#8211;like&#8211;like somebody
rattling little marbles, dry peas?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>The girl felt her own breath go ratatat
as she put the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-h! only some fellow rattling&#8211;rattling&#8211;beans
in his pocket. Let&#8217;s get
away&#8211;quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Pemrose knew what it was to
look upon a Stoutheart &#8220;rattled.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, with that, a voice, a cry, not loud,
but strong, exploded like a spring gun in
the cave,&#8211;suddenly halting advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that outside? What&#8217;s that
outside?&#8221; it whooped. &#8220;Is it an aÃ«roplane?
<i>Two</i> aÃ«roplanes? Oh! hurry out&#8211;and
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dozen aÃ«roplanes! A corps of aÃ«roplanes!&#8221;
boomed back those flaunting big
boys, of whom the nickum was leader,
playing up to the cue of the Scoutmaster
who had started the concentrated cry.
&#8220;Oh, hurry&#8211;hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw him fling his mayflowers on the
ground, that strange youth, and snatch at
Una&#8217;s hand, to drag her along towards
the low cave entrance. He made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
wide, circling movement to catch at hers,
too. But she dodged it. Never more
should he play Jack at a Pinch to her!
Never!</p>

<p>Through old Tory Cave there surged
the noise of a rising wind, silencing that
weak gust afar off, now baleful, the sound
of the hidden water; reverberating among
the rocks, it might be taken for anything,
for the hum of aircraft&#8211;for a perfect
onslaught of sky cavalry!</p>

<p>And the Scoutmaster&#8217;s cry was convincing.</p>

<p>Yet&#8211;yet, when boys and girls tumbled
tumultuously through the cave entrance&#8211;the
girls by some mysterious understanding,
first&#8211;not a remote sign of a biplane,
even a meager <i>one</i>, decorated the sky
overhead.</p>

<p>No flying wires sent down their challenge.
And the hum resolved itself into
what it was: the rising, random mockery
of Ta-te, the tempest, laughing at their
searching looks, going north, south, east
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
and west, aloft, skirmishing in bewilderment
to all points of the horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum-m. There isn&#8217;t a <i>sign</i> of a buzz-wagon!
Who pulled off that stunt&#8211;on&#8211;us?&#8221;
bleated a few of the mystified
younger boys, while Stud silently brushed
moisture like cave-tears from his forehead.</p>

<p>So did the tall Scoutmaster, heavily
breathing relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not an aÃ«roplane in sight! Not a
single one!&#8221; breezed the girls, all ready to
be angry. &#8220;Who&#8211;who put that hoax
over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Varnish right&#8211;and aÃ«roplane wrong!&#8221;
It was the freakish voice of a nickum which
answered. &#8220;No! No buzzer, as the boys
say, but there was a rattler, in there, beside
that rock. If some of you girls had gone
ahead, you&#8217;d have stepped right on him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A &#8216;rattler!&#8217; A big rattlesnake! And&#8211;and
you started the cry, to get us out
quietly&#8211;quickly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not we! The Scoutmaster had the
presence of mind to launch an aÃ«roplane.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
We boomed it,&#8221; came the laughing reply,
as Jack at a Pinch, second fiddle now,
marched off with his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8211;is he?&#8221; Pemrose caught wildly
at the arm of Stud, who was wishing that
he and not those patronizing big boys
had caught the Scoutmaster&#8217;s cue and
created airdrawn aÃ«roplanes by the corps.
&#8220;Do you&#8211;do you know who he is;
that biggest&#8211;that gaudiest&#8211;one among
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! No-o! I do&#8211;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t!&#8221;
stammered the boyish Henkyl Hunter. &#8220;I&#8211;we&#8211;&#8221;
indicating his scout brothers&#8211;&#8220;have
met him a couple of times in the
woods; I guess his father an&#8217; he have a
camp on the opposite side of the lake from
ours. We&#8217;ve talked with him&#8211;tried to
be friendly. And he&#8211;he&#8217;s always jolly,
you know&#8211;like now! But&#8211;but when
it comes to finding out anything about
either of them, gee, you might as well
whistle jigs to a milestone&#8211;so-o you
might!&#8221;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p><span class='sc'>Another</span> day of joy, indeed! Without
peril of rattlesnake&#8211;or marplot nickum
to spoil it!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Varnish right&#8211;and aÃ«roplane wrong!&#8217;
That&#8217;s what <i>he</i> said when they laid that
trap to get us out of the cave, without any
fuss. But I say it&#8217;s: &#8216;Varnish right&#8211;and
puzzle wrong!&#8217; All wrong!&#8221; snapped
Pemrose to herself again and again, repeating
an old saying during the week following
that first Get Together. &#8220;Nobody&#8211;nobody
has a right to drift around as a puzzle,
these days! If ever I get a chance, see me
snub him har-rd&#8211;though he did rescue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
me twice! Well, thank goodness! it was
the Scoutmaster, not he, who played Jack
at a Pinch in Tory Cave.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was the Scoutmaster, in days
gone by, with the help of his boys, who had
built the great stone fireplace in the girls&#8217;
bungalow in which a brilliant Council
Fire was now blazing. Across the lake
the golden glory stole, and girls came tip-toeing
to the hearth-flame in soft, ceremonial
dress, fringed and beaded, the firelight,
like dawn, flushing the pearl of their
headbands,&#8211;and Pem forgot the enigma
of that eighteen-year-old youth who seemed
to have a trick of bobbing up, now and
again, under the lee of a summer holiday,
like some menacing spar to leeward of a
vessel in fair sail.</p>

<p>Well! to recall Stud&#8217;s figure of speech,
nobody was &#8220;whistling jigs&#8221; to his milestone
heart now&#8211;or trying to. The fire
was the fiddler; and wax was not softer
or more responsive than the pliant breasts
on which its music fell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>&#8220;I watched a log in the fireplace burning.&#8221;</p>

<p>They whispered it one to another and
under the spell of its transfiguring lay,
bent forward, they witnessed the last act
in a pine-tree pantomime.</p>

<p>A dazzling transformation scene it was:
in the glow they could see, summed up,
each transition of light and heat that went
before: dawn&#8217;s tender flame, the fierce
blaze of high noon, ruby rays of evening
streaming now across the Bowl&#8211;hill-girt
lake without&#8211;gathered, all gathered,
in a golden age behind them to feed the sap
of a noble tree, here poured forth, amid a
radiant ballet of flame and spark, to furnish
life, light&#8211;inspiration&#8211;to a Council Fire.</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;I watched a log in the fireplace burning,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! if I, too, could only be</p>
<p>Sure to give back the love and laughter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That Life so freely gave to me!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Tanpa, the Guardian, softly breathed
it. And in the eye of more than one girl
the wish was transmuted into a tear,&#8211;into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
something more tender, more transported,
than a laugh, as the log, in a final
spurt, gave all, and fell, like a tired dancer,
upon the broad hearth, its rosy chiffons
crumpled and fading into the pale gray of
wood-ashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it goes!&#8221; The eyes of Pemrose
were a patchwork now, flame embroidered
upon their shining blue; oh! if she were
to give forth what Life gave to her, which
of her Camp Fire Sisters would have such
riches to reflect?</p>

<p>It had been hers&#8211;hers&#8211;to share the
dream of a great inventor, to look forward
with him to the pioneering moment&#8211;the
beginning of that which would surely, in
time, draw the Universe visibly together&#8211;the
moment when the Thunder Bird should
fly.</p>

<p>She never qualified that dream by an <i>if</i>,
wherever the funds to equip it might come
from&#8211;or even if it had to wait a dozen
years, Toandoah&#8217;s triumph, like that fortune
&#8220;hung up&#8211;&#8221; for the great Bird to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
make its new migration to the moon, in
proof that space was no barrier&#8211;when
the Thunder Bird, giving all, as the log had
done, would drop its skeleton upon the
desert of that silent satellite.</p>

<p>But there were steps to be taken in the
meantime&#8211;exciting steps in the ladder
of success. Those patchwork eyes, looking
into the flame now, counted them, one by
one, and hung in breathless anticipation
upon the first: upon the moment, so soon
to come off, when old Greylock would
really send back a shout of gladness, for
on his darkling summit the hand of a Camp
Fire Girl of America would press the button
and loose the lesser Thunder Bird to
fly up the modest distance of a couple of hundred
miles, or so, with its diary in its head,
and send back the novel record of its flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;do&#8211;believe that my father sleeps
with one eye open, thinking of that golden
egg, as he calls it&#8211;the little recording apparatus,&#8221;
she said, when the White Birch
Group, as one, asked that the special
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
program for this ceremonial meeting should be
a talk from an inventor&#8217;s daughter upon
this most daring enterprise of the age.
&#8220;He says that if <i>that</i> does not drift back
to earth safely with the crow-like parachute&#8211;if
anything should happen to it, to the
two little wheels, with the paper winding
from one on to the other, all dashed with
pencil marks&#8211;the world would call him
a fool&#8217;s mate.... If it did!&#8221; Pem&#8217;s
teeth were clinched. &#8220;But, of course, without
the record, there would be nothing to
show how high the little rocket had really
flown&#8211;showing the bigger one the road,&#8221;
with an excited gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can understand how anxious
he must be about the safe return of the
egg&#8211;or the log&#8211;whichever you choose
to call it&#8211;the first record from space,
anyway.&#8221; Tanpa&#8217;s tone was almost
equally excited. &#8220;And of course the wind
may play pranks with the parachute&#8211;drift
it away down the mountainside!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that we&#8217;d lose it in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
darkness&#8211;oh-h!&#8221; Pem shivered upon the thought.
&#8220;But we&#8217;ll all be on the lookout to prevent
that, as many of us as are there&#8211;and that
won&#8217;t be more than a picked few, Dad says,
to witness this first experiment.... When&#8211;when
the real Thunder Bird flies, though&#8211;&#8221;
she turned those patchwork eyes now,
sky-blue, flame-red, upon her companions&#8211;&#8220;you&#8217;ll
all&#8211;all-ll be there. And, oh!
won&#8217;t it&#8211;won&#8217;t it be a sight to watch&#8211;it&#8211;tear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drooping towards the fire-glow, lips
parted in entranced assurance, the slight
figure became lost in the same dream which
had held it months before in a February
Pullman, while a daring flame, like a red-capped
pearl diver, plunging into the mystery
of that fairy thing, that gleaming
stole about her neck brought out milky
flashes of luster&#8211;together with those New
Jerusalem tints, jade and gold and ruby.</p>

<p>Finished now it was, the pearl-woven
prophecy&#8211;fair record to go down to
posterity!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>In faith&#8211;such faith as had inspired
Penelope, faithful wife, of old, to weave
and unravel her endless web, steadfast in
the belief of her husband&#8217;s return, so the
girlish fingers upon the loom had wrought
the transcendent story to a finish.</p>

<p>To a finish even to the sprinkling of gold
pieces, the yellow bonanza, coming from
somewhere, to gorge the Thunder Bird,
for its record flight; to a finish even to the
celestial climax, the little blue powder-flash
lighting up the dear, fair face of Mammy
Moon!</p>

<p>But of one climax, more celestial still,
Pemrose Lorry could not speak, not even
to these her Camp Fire Sisters: of the
evening of the second wreck&#8211;the wreck
of hope after that third installment of a
disappointing will had been read&#8211;when
she had taken the four feet and a half
of pearl poem to her father&#8217;s workshop,
the grim hardware laboratory, and out of
the home of light, which she herself hardly
understood, in her young, young heart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
had told him, doubtful of the future, that
she knew the invention would win out&#8211;the
Thunder Bird go where nothing earthly
had ever gone before.</p>

<p>And he had whispered something&#8211;something
surpassing&#8211;about a Wise
Woman who saved a city.</p>

<p>It made sacred every thought now, and
humbled it, too, in the breast of this little
sixteen-year-old girl, with the mingled yarn
in her nature&#8211;the mingling spice in her
name.</p>

<p>Others had these fair stoles, too, the
history of their girlish lives woven in pearls
of typical purity, crossed by vivid representations
of events. Drooping to their
knees, in symbolic beauty, finishing with
the soft leather fringes on which a breeze
sweeping down the wide chimney played,
they flashed here and there in the high
colors of adventure&#8211;the quaintly symbolized
adventure tale.</p>

<p>But none could match the theme of the
two little primitive figures upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
mounttain-top, the inventor looking through a
tube, the comet-like streak of fire above
them: the opening of a highroad through
Space,&#8211;the first step towards a federation
of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>The record to go down to posterity!</p>

<p>Yet old Earth had still her individual
romance of seedtime and harvest, sun
and storm, peril and deliverance.</p>

<p>Emblematically depicted these were in
the pearl strip of a girl, with a winsome
reflection of Andrew&#8217;s thistle-burr in her
speech. Born &#8220;far awa&#8217; in bonnie Scotland&#8221;,
the thistle and America&#8217;s goldenrod
blent their purple and gold upon her
young shoulders; there was an idealized
plow, representing the peaceful agricultural
calling of her father,&#8211;and a jump
from peace to peril in the primitively
symbolized scene of a shipwreck through
which she had been with him when crossing
the Atlantic in a sailing vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had all to take to the boats, you
see,&#8221; said Jennie McIvor, &#8220;for the ship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
was leaking so badly that she couldn&#8217;t
keep afloat but a wee bit longer; and we
had a verra rough time until we were picked
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>A rough time, indeed, typified by the
wildly driven little canoes&#8211;the most
primitive form of the boat&#8211;tossed upon
stiff water-hills, brooding above them the
quaint, corkscrew figure, with the eye in
its head, of Ta-te, the tempest.</p>

<p>Somehow, this eye&#8211;the spying wind&#8217;s
eye&#8211;haunted Pemrose that night, curled
up in a previous suggestion of the Guardian&#8217;s
which, momentarily, had twisted itself,
snake-like, around her heart.</p>

<p>Suppose Ta-te should prove cruel to her,
as to Jennie whom she had eventually
spared! Suppose, on the great night of
the first experiment with Toandoah&#8217;s little
rocket, Ta-te, jealous of a rival in the small
Thunder Bird which could out-soar all the
winds of Earth&#8211;out-soar even the air,
their cradle&#8211;should meanly seize upon
the black, silk parachute, light as soot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
anchored to the golden egg, the little
recording apparatus! Suppose it should
whirl both off, away from the eager hands
stretched out to claim them, hide them in a
dark recess of the mountain side, maybe,
where they could not be found for days,&#8211;possibly
never!</p>

<p>Ta-te <i>could</i> play fast and loose with her
father&#8217;s reputation, she knew; at least, with
the witness to his success as an inventor.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the wind should do that,&#8221; she thought,
&#8220;then the World, some part of it&#8211;the
horrid World&#8211;will say that Mr. Hartley
Graham&#8217;s last thoughts about that mile-long
will were wise ones: that it was better&#8211;better
to leave all that money &#8216;hung
up&#8217; awaiting the possible return of that
madcap younger brother&#8211;who&#8217;ll make
ducks and drakes of it, most likely&#8211;than&#8211;than
to turn it over to a Thunder Bird,&#8221;
with a faint flash of a smile, &#8220;in spite, oh!
in spite of the fact that daring volunteers&#8211;skilled
aviators&#8211;are wild to take passage
in the far-flying Bird.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>Yes! even that youthful hotspur who
used the cream of rough-edged paper, and
was willing to try anything once, though
it should be once for all.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s thought reverted to him now
as she gazed into the bungalow fire, seeing
in the gusty flicker of every log that menacing
spiral,&#8211;the brooding wind&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>It claimed her, that wild, red eye, even
while her companions of the White Birch
Group were excitedly discussing their picturesque
plans for the morrow; for the
celebration of their annual festival in honor
of the birch trees bursting into leaf, for the
odes, the songs, the dances, the planting,
each, of a silvery sapling.</p>

<p>It mesmerized her, did Ta-te&#8217;s eye, with
its setting of flame, even to the exclusion
of enthusiasm about the big dance&#8211;the
joyous Together&#8211;in the evening, of which
Una raved in anticipation now and again,
and for which these two friends and rivals
in the matter of eyelashes had brought
their prettiest party dresses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>The elders presiding over the destinies
of both had given a happy consent to Tanpa&#8217;s
invitation, and the two were now the
guests for a few days of the mountain
Group at their camp on the egg-shaped
Bowl.</p>

<p>The sigh of the mountain breeze came
soothingly across the lake to lull their
slumbers as they lay down to rest, side by
side, in the little bungalow cots of which a
dozen ranged the length of the great water-side
dormitory half-open, half-screened.</p>

<p>Yet Pem fell asleep imploring Ta-Te&#8211;and
lost the little record altogether in her
dreams!</p>

<p>Up and down old Greylock she plodded,
looking for it, hand in hand with Toandoah,&#8211;but
ever it eluded them!</p>

<p>Muttering, bereft, she tossed; then for a
moment awoke, blinkingly sat up, to see
the moonlight flickering&#8211;Mammy Moon&#8217;s
own smile&#8211;upon the pearl-woven prophecy
beside her, from which she could
hardly be parted by night or day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>Sleep again! And now it was not only
the diary but the Thunder Bird, itself,
that was lost,&#8211;astray in space, and she
with it!</p>

<p>She was trying to catch it by the fiery
tail-feathers when, all of a sudden&#8211;all
of a sober sudden&#8211;those feathers became
soft, flopping, buffeting,&#8211;real.</p>

<p>They brushed her parted lips. They
flopped against her cheek. They even
mopped the dews of slumber from her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hea-vens! W-what is it-t?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wildly she sat up&#8211;a second time&#8211;to
see the dawn poking at her with a pink
finger and the lake shimmering without,
a great pearl found by the morning in an
iridescent oyster-shell of mist.</p>

<p>And, within, a bumping, buffeting something,
soft as moss, dun-gray as terror&#8211;blundering
into every sleeper&#8217;s face, as if
testing its warmth, bowling its way along
the line of cots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cluck! Cluck! Flutter! Flutter! Awake!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
Awake! I&#8217;m lost! I&#8217;m lost!&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? <i>What is it?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Never was such an exciting reveille as
girl by girl bounded up&#8211;elastic&#8211;fingering
a brushed, a tickled cheek.</p>

<p>The answer was a screech that made the
morning blush, as if a ghost had invaded
the Tom Tiddler&#8217;s ground of open day
light.</p>

<p>Una shrieked in echo.</p>

<p>Morale was undermined. Cots were vacated.
Maiden jostled maiden, all colliding
upon a gaping question that fanned sensation
sky-high&#8211;until the bungalow fairly
rocked upon a hullabaloo.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>A Novel Santa Claus</span></span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>It&#8217;s</span> an Owl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only an owl&#8211;a little screech owl!
Not&#8211;not so little, either! Where did it
come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! How on earth did it get in?
Doors&#8211;windows&#8211;all are screened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory halleluiah! It came down the
chimney. Look&#8211;look at the black on
its feathers, the wood-smuts clinging to it!
Down the big chimney of the living room!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like Santa Claus down the chimney!
Mercy! d&#8217;you suppose it played Santa
itself? or did the boys push it down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys! Those miserable Henkyl
Hunters&#8211;always on the trail of a joke!
If they did, they&#8217;ll never own up!
Never!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>Such was the substance of the uproar
as the downy ball of mopping feathers
took on a beak, claws and big brown eyes,
blank and round, perching upon the foot-rail
of a cot!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s as bad as the bats in Tory
Cave. And they were so-o hor-rid!&#8221;
wailed Una. &#8220;It&#8211;it just tickled my
lips with its wing. Bah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad! It&#8217;s not bad, at all; it&#8217;s dear,&#8221;
cooed Jessie, the merle, feeling instant
kinship with the bewildered bird. &#8220;Girls!
Girls! I believe it&#8217;s blind&#8211;blind as a
bat, or as the pale fish in the cave. There
it goes&#8211;look&#8211;knocking its head, this
way and that, against the wall!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, the fluttering thing, of a sudden
taking to flight again, was now playing
shuttlecock, feathered shuttlecock, to the
battledore of a broad sunbeam which
batted it wildly hither and yon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! keep back&#8211;quiet&#8211;maybe, &#8217;twill
settle down again,&#8221; pleaded the merle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t it the face of a cunning little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
kitten? Such a wise, blinking, round-eyed
kitten! Its head is reddish, not gray&#8211;and
the rufous markings on its breast, too!
Oh-h! I wonder if the boys did catch it
in the woods and thought it was a good
&#8216;henkyl&#8217; to put down our chimney?&#8221;</p>

<p>But that, as the girls knew, would remain
as blind a puzzle as the long, screened
dormitory was to the dazzled owl, unable
to see clearly in daylight, out visiting when
he should have been in bed in the cool,
dark hollow of a tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-oo-ooo ... cluck!&#8221; it cooed
and grumbled, pressing a dappled breast
and wide-spread wings against a screen,
the mottled back-feathers ruffling into a
huge breeze-swept pompon.</p>

<p>&#8220;See! He&#8217;s playing he&#8217;s a big owl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I wonder if he&#8217;d let me&#8211;let
me catch him.&#8221; Jessie sighed yearningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do-o, and we&#8217;ll tame him&#8211;keep him for
a mascot!&#8221; It was a general acclamation.</p>

<p>And the feathered Santa, apparently
having no objection to this rÃ«le&#8211;finding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
himself no longer a waif in Babel&#8211;finally
settled down again on the glittering head-rail
of Una&#8217;s cot, his fluffy breast to the
outdoor sunlight, his solemn, kittenish face&#8211;the
head turning round on a pivot
without the movement of a muscle in the
body&#8211;confronting sagely the delighted
girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he the dearest thing? Oh! I&#8217;m
glad the boys played the trick&#8211;if it was
the boys. I&#8217;d rather think he played
Santa himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no inkling in Jessie&#8217;s mind,
as, so murmuring and softly barefoot, she
stole up to the visitor, now motionless as a
painted bird, of a much worse trick that
those freakish Henkyl Hunters might play,
a girl abetting them, too&#8211;shocking fact&#8211;before
night fell again upon the pearly Bowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-ooo! Boo! See me reverse!&#8221;
It seemed to be what the owl was saying
to the maidens as he turned the tables on
them again and again with that teetotum
trick of his swivel neck.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>But he did not scream any more or
offer the least objection when the merle took
him to her tender breast, cooing reassurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! you&#8217;ve got a new singing
teacher, Jess&#8211;a little screech owl. Little!
My! he&#8217;s big for a small-eared owl, isn&#8217;t
he?&#8211;nearly a foot long. Brush the camouflage
off him&#8211;the smuts of the chimney!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;well, whether he enacted Santa
Claus of his own accord, or whether he
didn&#8217;t&#8211;&#8221; thus Tanpa broke in on the
last flow of speech which was a medley&#8211;&#8220;he&#8217;s
brought us one gift, anyway, the
gift of a glorious day for our annual White
Birch celebration.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did prove a banner day, from the
breakfast out of doors on the wide piazza
in that matchless warmth of early summer
when buds are bursting, trees singing themselves
into leaf&#8211;for &#8220;all deep things are
song&#8211;&#8221; when the inquisitive breeze peeps
longingly into the yellow heart of the first
wild rose and May is bourgeoning, flowering,
into the joy of June.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>Below the bungalow the three-mile lake,
a mile and a half across&#8211;the transfigured
Bowl&#8211;was still a softly glowing
pearl, treasured in cotton-wool mists which
entirely hid its real framing of lofty hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the mountains cease playing
blindman&#8217;s buff with each other, then&#8211;then
it will be time for our morning swim,
won&#8217;t it? The first real swim of the season,
too,&#8221; murmured Tomoke, the signaling
maiden, nestling coaxingly near to the presiding
Guardian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you think the water will be
warm enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it was quite warm yesterday when
we paddled out around the float&#8211;the
floating pier.&#8221; Jessie, who was tempting
the feathered Santa Claus, pampered captive
under her arm, with every tidbit she
could think of, from cereal to lake-cod
caught by the girls themselves, looked down
at that buoyant pier&#8211;a golden raft, at
the moment&#8211;tossing a dozen yards from
the base of a fifteen-foot cliff where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
shore jumped sharply down to the water.
Yesterday it had been wreathed with
boughs for the coming festival: the swimming
structure, naÃ«vely composed of two
great barrels, boarded over, with a broad
plank, as a bridge, running out ashore.</p>

<p>To it a couple of shining canoes and two
broad camp boats were moored; it also
served as a springboard for diving.</p>

<p>Built by girl-carpenters themselves&#8211;with
a little masculine help&#8211;presently
to be garlanded with daisy-chains and
buttercups, for the June carnival, and to
hide its crudity, it stood, so the Guardian
thought, exquisitely for the practical and
the poetic in Camp Fire life, which ever in
&#8220;glorifying Work&#8221; seeks Beauty!</p>

<p>The sun was seeking that too, just now,
gloating over his own noble reflection in the
green-lipped Bowl,&#8211;benevolently promising,
indeed, a day hot for the season, as
well as radiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! the temperature has taken a leap
ahead,&#8221; said Tanpa musingly. &#8220;I think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
you can go in&#8211;for a short swim, any
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Notify me&#8211;notify me if you see me
drowning&#8211;for I can&#8217;t hear the voice of
doom through my bathing cap!&#8221; laughed
Una Grosvenor, two hours later, in consequence
of this permission, wading coyly
out beyond the float, to where the lake-water
rose over the crossed logs of the
Camp Fire emblem on the breast of her
blue bathing suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! she&#8217;s in no danger of drowning;
she swims better than I&#8211;I do-o now,&#8221;
shivered Pemrose, rather wishing that June
were July and the Bowl had undergone the
gradual glow of a heating process. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
you coming, Thrush?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
you coming in, Jessie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave the owl! I believe the
boys meant him as an anniversary present&#8211;though
they went about presenting him
in a queer way,&#8221; was the fostering answer.</p>

<p>The other girls, however, were in the
water, as those grigs of boys had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
before them; the Bowl seemed to froth
with their laughter, spray creaming around
the bare, sunflushed arms flung above it,
as if the lake itself, in festive mood, were a
sentient sharer in the joy of these daring
June bathers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&#8211;now who wants to dress and
come out in the boats for a study of pond-life
under the microscope?&#8221; cried the
Guardian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoo! Whoo! That&#8211;that&#8217;s a bait
to which the fish always rise,&#8221; cried one and
another, eagerly splashing ashore blue
of brow and covered with gooseflesh, yet
loath to admit that on this the feathered
Santa Claus&#8217; gift of a prematurely perfect
June day the creamy Bowl was still too
emphatically a cooler.</p>

<p>Up the rude sod steps of the cliff they
trooped&#8211;a bevy of shivers&#8211;fleeing for
warmth and the shelter of the bungalow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo-oo! I&#8217;ve never been in bathing
so early in the year before,&#8221; shook out
Pemrose, to whom the experience&#8211;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
lingering chill of this mountain Bowl many
hundred feet above sea-level&#8211;was rather
too much of a weak parody upon her last
freshwater ducking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you&#8217;ll soon warm up. Come,
hurry and dress! It&#8217;s no end of fun studying
water-snails and egg-boats&#8211;gnats&#8217;
funny egg-boats&#8211;under a microscope, with
the Scoutmaster,&#8221; encouraged Tomoke, in
everyday life Ina Atwood, blue as her
lightning namesake, and rather hankering
after the warmth of her pine-knot
torch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es; and&#8211;and minnows&#8211;where
every one of them is&#8211;is a chief Triton
among the minnows!&#8221; laughed another
girl, scrambling into her clothes. &#8220;Meaning
no minnows, at all&#8211;all-ll Tritons!&#8221;</p>

<p>All Tritons, sure enough, rosy Tritons,
brilliant now in the early summer, the
breeding season, with wonderful colors, the
males, especially.</p>

<p>Swimming about, near the surface, as the
minnows usually do, the clear waters of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
June Bowl became for the girls, looking,
one by one through the large microscope
over the boat&#8217;s side, a &#8220;vasty deep&#8221; in
which leviathans played&#8211;fairy fish&#8211;seeing
everything rose-color, painting themselves
to ecstasy with the joys of mating,
the joy of June.</p>

<p>&#8220;See&#8211;see they&#8217;re not all red&#8211;or
partly so&#8211;s-such a lovely pinky-red, especially
around the fins and head&#8211;that&#8217;s
where they keep their pigment,&#8221; said
Tanpa. &#8220;Some have colored themselves
like goldfish; others are greenish&#8211;or lighter
yellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! While others, again, are gotten
up as if for a minstrel show for their marriage&#8211;painted
black, for the time being!&#8221;
laughed her husband, the tall Scout Officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s why we like, girls and
boys, to come down to our camp early in
the season&#8211;if only at intervals&#8211;because
we watch the summer coming and can study
the wonderful lake life as at no other time,&#8221;
remarked the Guardian again, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
subsided into private life in the stern of the
broad, red camp-skiff, scribbling something
in verse form to be read at the White Birch
celebration in the afternoon when land as
well as lake was a-riot with young color,
strewn with wild flowers for gay June to
tread on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! isn&#8217;t it the most wonderful&#8211;wonderful
season? In the city we go
camping too late. The freshness isn&#8217;t
there.&#8221; Pem&#8217;s eyes were dim as she applied
one to the lens of the microscope, to
gaze once more at the painted Tritons;
she was glad that in the freshness of the
year it was&#8211;oh! so soon now&#8211;that the
little Thunder Bird would momentarily
color the skies and paint the World rose-colored
in excitement over its demonstration&#8211;over
the heights that could be
reached&#8211;paving the way for the Triton
of Tritons to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! if we spend any more time with
the minnows, we&#8217;ll have to &#8216;cut out&#8217; the
&#8216;fresh-water sheep&#8217;, the little roaches, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
the insects&#8217; egg-boats,&#8221; said the Scoutmaster.
&#8220;Speaking of the latter, I saw a
curious one yesterday upon a stagnant
pool over on the other side of the lake;
perhaps the visitors would be interested in
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The visitors were interested in the bare
mention. Warming equally to comfort and
excitement again, they clamored&#8211;Pemrose
and Una&#8211;for a sight of that raft
of gnats&#8217; eggs, so cunningly formed and
glued together, minute egg to egg, hundreds
of them, that it was a regular lifeboat&#8211;no
storm could sink it, and pressure only
temporarily.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, Pemrose only half heard
the Scoutmaster&#8217;s explanation of how the
insect chose a floating stick or straw as a
nucleus, placed her forelegs on it and laid
the egg upon her hind ones, holding it there
until she had brought forth another to join
it, gluing the two together by their sticky
coating,&#8211;and so on till the broad and
buoyant boat was constructed!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>Pemrose hardly heard, for as the party
made its way to that stagnant pool, an overflow
at some time of the sparkling Bowl,
and hidden in a dense little wood, she had
a sudden demonstration of how, under
certain circumstances, a girl&#8217;s heart is
much more capsizable than a gnat&#8217;s egg-boat.</p>

<p>Hers positively turned turtle&#8211;yes!
really, turned turtle&#8211;at sight of a long,
gray figure lying, breast down, amid undergrowth
upon the margin of a little stream
that was hurrying away from it to the
lake.</p>

<p>She felt momentarily topsy-turvy, every
bit of her, for anywhere on earth&#8211;aye,
even if she were scouring space with the
Thunder Bird&#8211;she would recognize that
angular figure.</p>

<p>It had once pulled her up a snow-bank
to the distant rumble of an engine&#8217;s explosion.</p>

<p>Yes, and surely she had seen it again,
once again, since then&#8211;although,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
sandwiched as it now was between egg-boats
and painted Tritons she could not&#8211;for
the moment&#8211;remember where.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine day! Having luck? Catching
anything?&#8221; hailed the Scoutmaster, with
genial interest, as one woodsman to another,
for the figure was angling with a fly-rod.</p>

<p>The latter shot a side long glance at the
party from under a broad Panama hat,&#8211;then
jammed that, rather uncivilly, further
down upon his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! The fish aren&#8217;t ex-act-ly jumping
out of the water, saying &#8216;Hullo!&#8217; to
you!&#8221; it returned in the freakish drawl of
a masked battery, shrinking deeper into
cover amid the ferns.</p>

<p>Yet, when the Nature students had
passed on, one quivering girl, with ears
intently on the alert, heard it fire off something
in the same fern-cloaked rumble
about a certain fly being a &#8220;perfect peach&#8221;
to fish with.</p>

<p>And the answer came in clear, ringing,
boyish tones&#8211;from another angler
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
presumably&#8211;momentarily rainbowing the
wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;sure&#8211;that Parmachene belle
is <i>the girl</i>, Dad! If&#8211;if there&#8217;s a trout in
the stream, she&#8217;ll put the &#8216;come hither!&#8217;
on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! Likening a trout-fly to a girl!
So like his &#8217;nickum&#8217; impudence!&#8221; Pem&#8217;s
teeth&#8211;in her present mood&#8211;came together
with a snap. And, of course, she
couldn&#8217;t see the gnat&#8217;s raft when she arrived
at the stagnant puddle, for she had
borrowed the gnat&#8217;s sting with which to
barb the snub which she meant to inflict,
some time, upon that angling youth who
had sat, unabashed, in the Devil&#8217;s Chair,&#8211;if
ever luck held out a chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;yes! and if he had played Jack
at a Pinch forty-eleven million times, I&#8217;d
do it.&#8221; Her eyes were flashing now like
the sky-dots in the pool, forked by iridescent
shadows. &#8220;So&#8211;so <i>here&#8217;s</i> where
they have their camp,&#8221; craning her neck
for a glimpse of a log-cabin amid the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
spruces. &#8220;Stud said it was just across
the lake from the girls&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>After that&#8211;well! who could be interested
in gnat-boats when they had just
lit upon the ambush of a Puzzle; a puzzle
that would only open in a pinch and shut
up, like a Chinese ring-box, afterwards?</p>

<p>And, moreover, that woodland lurking-place
was just a bare mile and a half across
the Bowl from the floating barrel pier,
decked, as it was built, by girls&#8217; hands, and
from the great heart&#8217;s-ease bungalow, now,
too, in process of decoration for the gala
time in the afternoon around the White
Birch totem; and for the blissful, far-off
event, drawing nearer with every shining
moment, the brilliant piazza, dance in the
evening!</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>It was Tanpa, with the sunburst upon
her right breast, general symbol of the
Camp Fire, and the birch tree in grace
of green and silver embroidered above
it upon emerald khaki, who read the
verses which she had scribbled in the
skiff&#8217;s stern under cover of the general
interest in water-snails, eggboats and
&#8220;fresh-water sheep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most beautiful of forest trees&#8211;the
Lady of the Woods!&#8221; came the responsive
hail from eighteen green-clad maidens,
tiptoeing around the Silver Lady, the
emerald tassels of their Tam-o&#8217;-shanters
skipping in the June breeze that peeped
under her fluttering veil, still tucked with
buds, to kiss those white limbs lifted to
the skies, with surely, some bud of conscious
joy.</p>

<p>It was June! Upon the cliff-brow, above
the lake, wild roses were budding, too;
and the girls&#8217; cheeks painted themselves
with their reflection&#8211;even as did the
blushing minnows in the lake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>But the lady of the woods had the
best of it so far as decoration went. Never
new-crowned head wore in its coronet
Life as hers did,&#8211;fledgling life.</p>

<p>For amid the heart-shaped leaves, so
brightly green, was the cap-sheaf of summer
wear:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;A nest of robins in her hair.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The poet who penned that line would
have gloried in the sight of her, that bungalow
birch tree, a tall, straight specimen,
radiant as a silver taper from the black,
frescoed ring about the foot to the topmost
ivory twig, and here and there
amid the fluttering, pea-green tresses a
little tuft of conscious life&#8211;a nestling
with open beak and craving, coralline
throat.</p>

<p>He would have joyed in the sight of the
tree-loving Group, too, as the earth was
turned and the first silver sapling rooted
deep to the music of Tomoke&#8217;s voice,
softly proclaiming:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>&#8220;He who plants a tree,</p>
<p>He plants love.</p>
<p>Tents of coolness spreading out above</p>
<p>Wayfarers he may not live to see.</p>
<p>Gifts that grow are best,</p>
<p>Hands that bless are blest,</p>
<p>Plant! Life does the rest.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And Life would do the rest&#8211;oh! surely&#8211;in
the case of her father and herself,
was the dewy thought of Pemrose Lorry
as she planted her baby tree in honor of
that novel Wayfarer, that would first
traverse space and conquer it&#8211;bridge
the gulf which made Earth a hermit amid
the heavenly bodies&#8211;of the great invention,
whereof poets in future ages
would sing, that daringly took the first
step towards linking planet with planet.</p>

<p>And the tender sapling was rooted in
the hope that long before it was a mature
tree that comet-like Wayfarer would start,&#8211;the
Thunder Bird would fly.</p>

<p>Well! star-dust never blinded the eyes.
But it certainly dazzled those of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
Pemrose, that young visionary, as she pressed
earth around her sapling&#8217;s root: would
there ever come a time when the Camp
Fires of Earth would hail the Camp Fires
of some other planet across that illimitable
No Man&#8217;s Land of Space, first&#8211;oh!
thought transcendent&#8211;first bridged by
her father&#8217;s genius?</p>

<p>But with the high seasoning of that
thought came the salty smack of another!
All unseen in the planting excitement a
tear dropped upon the spading trowel as
she thought of that whimsical &#8220;Get thee
behind me, Satan, but don&#8217;t push!&#8221; plea
of the inventor sorely tempted to commercialize
his genius, thwart its inspired range,
because of the difficulties about bringing
his project to fruition&#8211;and of that money
hung up, idle, for the next twelve years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy-man thinks he&#8217;ll be&#8211;well!
not an old man, but that his best energies
will be spent by that time, even if&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here the trowel dug vigorously,
burying head over ears the thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
the possible return within that time of the
&#8220;zany&#8221; who had been such a mad fellow
in youth that, according to her father
and others, it was like sitting on
a barrel of gunpowder to have
anything to do with him, so sure
were you to come to grief through
his explosive pranks. And yet, and
yet&#8211;perhaps it was the dash of
spice in her name&#8211;Pem could not
help feeling an interest for his own sake
in that &#8220;hot tamale&#8221;, the Thunder Bird&#8217;s
rival in the will!</p>

<p>So she spaded away, watering her sapling
for the first time, herself, with that
little tributary tear; and then, propitiating
it, after the manner of the Indians,
in the graceful Leaf Dance, capering
around it, around the Queen Birch, too,
with her companions, upon the lightest
fantastic toe, their green arms outstretched
and waving, to imitate the leaves above
them, blown by the wind.</p>

<p>Went the phonograph upon the bungalow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
piazza, as it threw off the music, the
quaint Indian accompaniment to those
stamping, shuffling, skipping feet, to the
queer little half-savage syllables, borrowed
from the Creek Indians, upon the
lips of the chanting, dancing girls, to
the coconut hand-rattle wielded by Aponi,
the Butterfly, most fairy-like of the green
dancers, as she led and led, in honor of
the new <i>idlwissi</i>, or tree-hair, the listening
leaves&#8211;ethereal partners overhead.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i4'></a><img src='images/illus-mus.jpg' alt='' />
</div>

<p>Containing little pebbles picked from
the lake-side, with a stick running through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
the painted coconut-shell for a handle,
its gleeful rattle fairly turned girls&#8217; heads
with the joy of June.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll have to ask you to repeat
that dance to-night for the benefit
of the boys, your guests,&#8221; said the Scoutmaster,
who was manipulating the phonograph.
&#8220;Fairyland wouldn&#8217;t be &#8216;in it&#8217;
with the human leaves tripping in pink
and gold and green and&#8211;no ordinary
man knows what!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fairyland, indeed, seemed beaten hollow
as &#8220;across the lake in golden glory&#8221; the
waning sunbeams of early June bathed
the little floating pier, wreathed in laurel
and daisy chains, then climbed with flagging
feet, like a tired angel, the sod-steps
cut into the side of the steep cliff, and,
gaining the top, joined their rose-colored
brothers skipping among girlish forms
in every fair hue imaginable, claiming
partners in a dance as of Northern Lights
before ever their human brothers, the scouts
in gilded khaki, got a chance at a reel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>&#8220;Oh! I feel it in my toes that this is
going to be a won-der-ful party,&#8221; said
Toandoah&#8217;s little pal, kicking lightly, impatiently
with those satin toes of her
party slippers at the tufted grass, as she
sat enthroned upon the sod of the cliff&#8217;s
brow, with two knights beside her, Stud
of the stout heart, and a bright-eyed
luckless tenderfoot, whose parents, in a
fit of dementia surely, had named him
Louis Philip Green, which, as he used only
the initial letter of his second name, had
of course entailed a nickname.</p>

<p>&#8220;You promised you&#8217;d dance the
Lancers with me, although I&#8217;m only a
tenderfoot,&#8221; said Peagreen, nibbling a
blade of grass as he lay prone upon the
sod and shooting a glance, bright and
eager as a robin&#8217;s, in the direction of the
black-haired girl with those skybeams in
her eyes under inky lashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! The cheek of some kids who
ought to be tucked up in their Beehive
when&#8211;when that dance comes off!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
grumbled the fifteen-year-old Stud, with
the arrogance of a Patrol Leader, directing
his glance at a brown, conical bungalow
flanking a large one, where the younger
boys turned in at what seemed to them
unseemly hours, while scout veterans sat
up overhauling the day&#8217;s doings for an
occasion of a laugh against somebody,
practical joke, of course, preferred, to be
published in the Henkyl Hunter&#8217;s typewritten
Bulletin and hung up in the porch
next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I&#8217;m safe for the Grand March,
anyhow&#8211;and the Virginia reel, too, eh!&#8221;
Stud dug congratulatory fists into his
brown sides, wriggling aggressively upon
the cliff-brow, like Peagreen figuratively
hugging the ground with an impatient
nose.</p>

<p>Privately he was inclined to the opinion
that the blue-eyed girl&#8217;s friend who had
that little nearsighted stand in one of
her dark eyes, and two dimples to Pemrose&#8217;s
one, was the daintier &#8220;peach&#8221; of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
the two&#8211;and that his own sister, Jess,
was as pretty as either; but think of the
distinction of leading off with a girl whose
father would lead off amid the dance of
planets, in sending a messenger to the
moon, Mars, too, maybe!</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoopee!&#8221; He kicked the sod as
if spurning it as common or garden earth&#8211;although
there were moments when,
like others&#8211;elders&#8211;in a skeptical world,
he told himself that the Thunder Bird
would prove, after all, a Flying Dutchman,&#8211;just
an extravagant dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8211;so you were out on the lake
this morning, studying pond life with the
professor,&#8221; he said, alluding to the Scoutmaster.
&#8220;He&#8217;s instructor in a college
and each year he gets us started on something;
last summer it was astronomy&#8211;he
brought a small telescope along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pem&#8217;s heels drummed more excitedly
on the sod&#8211;the starry heavens were <i>her</i>
scope.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we have a good deal of fun with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
the big compound microscope, too&#8211;and
more without it,&#8221; acknowledged Studley.
&#8220;Fancy last week we caught a huge pike
which had jumped clear out of the water,
on to the bank, after a water-hen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was that? How&#8211;how big
was it?&#8221; The girlish questions mounted
helter-skelter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pike? Oh! he weighed about
fifteen pounds. It was right over there,
on the other side of the lake,&#8221; pointing
to the spot where the party interested
in egg-boats had landed that morning.
&#8220;He&#8211;he gobbled the hen, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Did</i> he?&#8221; But he might have been
threatening to gobble her, judging by the
start which the girl gave at the moment.</p>

<p>Her heart jumped down to the water&#8217;s
edge as abruptly as did the cliff beneath
her.</p>

<p>Her eyes were on a boat rowing out of
the sunset&#8217;s eye directly across the lake
from that very spot.</p>

<p>There was but one individual in it and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
he&#8211;he was rowing by instinct, as the
birds fly, for his gaze was glued to a newspaper
sheet, the sun&#8217;s own evening edition,
gorgeously printed by the painted rays
in every hue of the spectrum.</p>

<p>He was heading straight&#8211;straight for
the floating wharf with its plank-bridge
running out ashore.</p>

<p>Jack at a Pinch again!</p>

<p>&#8220;Do&#8211;do you know who he is?&#8221; Pem
flashed the question upon the older of
her two boy-knights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well-ll! I guess so.&#8221; Stud&#8217;s joy in
the recognition floundered a little. &#8220;He&#8211;he&#8217;s
the fellow&#8211;one of the fellows&#8211;who
boomed the aÃ«roplane, the other
day, to get you girls quietly out of the
cave, when there was a &#8216;rattler&#8211;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if we&#8217;d have made a fuss, anyhow!&#8221;
The girl&#8217;s eyes blazed, again a
patchwork, drawing their red center from
the sun. &#8220;You said&#8211;you said that it
was so hard to make friends with him,
like whistling jigs to a milestone&#8211;ah!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
Her own voice was suddenly stony.
&#8220;Have you&#8211;oh! have you made any
headway since?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Yes. I&#8217;ve found out something
about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The patrol leader&#8217;s preoccupied eyes
were on the boat edging vaguely nearer
to the wharf, with its one &#8220;nickum&#8221;
figure, so nonchalantly rowing, so absorbed
in the rainbowed sheet upon its knees
that at this moment it awkwardly
&#8220;caught a crab&#8221; and almost suggestively
lost an oar.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, however, the phonograph
on the piazza struck up, as a prelude
to festivities, the Virginia reel, the
notes tripping gaily out across the painted
lake; and the rower shot one glance upward,
as if to say: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there in time!&#8221;
then bent his hungry nose to the paper
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;what did you find out about
him?&#8221; Pem&#8217;s interest was equally hungry&#8211;positively
famishing. &#8220;His name&#8211;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>&#8220;Ha&#8211;that&#8217;s the question! Over on
Greylock the farmers&#8217; sons call him Shooting
Star&#8217;, alias &#8216;Starry&#8217;,&#8221; with a boyish
laugh, &#8220;because when they were awf&#8217;ly
hard up for a player in the last ball game
of the series against Willard College, having
lost their second baseman and substitute
too, by gracious! he breezed along, an&#8217; the
captain, hearing he had played on a college
team, roped him in ... an&#8217;&#8211;an&#8217;, what
do you know, but he won the game for
that mountain team with a home run!
A home run over the left field fence!
Bully!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, surely, <i>they</i> know his&#8211;real&#8211;name!&#8221;
Pem&#8217;s aloof absorption in that
fell like fog-drip even upon the glow from
that left field fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe they do&#8211;and maybe they
don&#8217;t! He refused it to the fans. And
when the Greylock coach cornered him he
palmed it off as Selkirk. But my cousin
who&#8217;s pitcher on the team says in his
opinion that was just &#8216;throwing a tub to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
whale&#8217;&#8211;something fishy about it, see?&#8221;
Stud winked. &#8220;For &#8216;Starry&#8217; an&#8217; his father&#8211;who&#8217;s
a queer fish, if ever there was
one&#8211;had a camp then up on Greylock
peak, and the postmaster in charge o&#8217;
the Greylock mail owned that he received
letters for them addressed to another name&#8211;only
he couldn&#8217;t&#8211;wouldn&#8217;t&#8211;give it
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Wha-at!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Pem&#8217;s hand suddenly smote her lips.</p>

<p>Her wide eyes were no patchwork now.
Stud had not thought that a girl&#8217;s eyes
could be so blue. It almost gave him
the &#8220;Willies&#8221;, their remote, peculiar sky-glow,
as if afar&#8211;afar&#8211;they were seeing
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; she gasped again, while that
vivid glow faded, became bluish, blank,
the tint of &#8220;Moonshine&#8221;&#8211;of a strange,
wild, nondescript dream.</p>

<p>Moonshine that seemed flooding her
whole being!</p>

<p>And yet&#8211;although she was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
quick-witted girl&#8211;it was too vague for her to
draw from it one clear thought&#8211;only an
uneasy, unreal, absolutely breathless feeling!</p>

<p>And then the queer, air-drawn sensation
as suddenly passed&#8211;and with it
the blue moon which had momentarily
turned her world to nothing&#8211;&#8220;shooed&#8221;
off by a very real, very tangible, quite
pressing apprehension:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8211;he&#8217;s not coming to the da-nce?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sprang up hurriedly, pointing to
the boat below; to its one preoccupied
figure, clad neither in rough sweater nor
May-fly gaudiness, now, but, if the sunset
didn&#8217;t exaggerate, in a very becoming
dark suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I don&#8217;t know! I guess he
is! Didn&#8217;t think he could pull it off for
some reason or other&#8211;&#8221; Stud&#8217;s shoulders
were shrugged. &#8220;But, maybe, he&#8217;s found
where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why-y?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s lips were parted
breathlessly, her foot involuntarily stamping.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>&#8220;Oh! you know you told us to invite
our friends to the party; not you, but the
other girls did, when they signaled across
that night from the green Pinnacle&#8211;gee!
and it was some signaling, too.&#8221;
The scout&#8217;s glance was teasing now as
it shot up from the grass. &#8220;So&#8211;so
one of the older boys he ran across that
bunch o&#8217; fellows who were blooming round
in the cave the other day&#8211;they&#8217;re all
from camps on the lake&#8211;and invited the
whole five. This one thought he couldn&#8217;t
accept, but I guess he&#8217;s making a dash
at it&#8211;at coming just the same!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!... Oh, <i>dear</i>! I wish he
wasn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Now it was the scout&#8217;s turn
to hang, breathless, upon the interrogation
as he too jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&#8211;oh! because I&#8217;d be&#8211;be
ever so much more comfortable without
him&#8211;enjoy myself more.&#8221; Pem caught
her breath wildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then &#8217;twill be A. W. O. L. for him!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
... A. W. O. L. for him&#8211;if I perish
for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;what does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absent With-Out Leave, as they set
it down in the Army!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mischief leaped to the Henkyl Hunter&#8217;s
eye.</p>

<p>He beckoned Peagreen from the grass
to follow him. A whisper in the tender-foot&#8217;s
ear and down the winding sod-steps
of the cliff they scrambled!</p>

<p>Pem knew that she ought to call them
back; knew it from the white parting at
the side of her throbbing little head to
the toe of her satin slipper tumultuously
beating the ground, as she sank down, an
orchid amid her chiffons, to watch.</p>

<p>But it was a moment when the spice of
her chowchow name had all spilled over;
when the Vain Elf which, according to her
father, slept in the shadow of the Wise Woman,
was broadly&#8211;mutinously&#8211;awake.</p>

<p>The boat had drawn in alongside the
decked float now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>It was gently rocking there, on and off,
the rower having shipped his oars and
laid them beside him, his strong fingers
now and again hooking the wharf when
there was danger of his drifting away,
while his obsessed nose was bent closer
still to the newspaper sheet, catching the
last rays of daylight on it.</p>

<p>He did not look up when the scouts,
running out over the plank bridge, spoke
to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of them&#8211;Stud it was&#8211;leaned
down and snatched the oars, lifted
them high in the air, the nickum&#8217;s evil
genius having prompted him to lay them
in the boat&#8217;s side nearest the wharf; perhaps
it was the demon which he had dared
by sitting in the Devil&#8217;s Chair.</p>

<p>At the same time Peagreen gave the
boat a strong shove outward to where a
current caught it and swept it further&#8211;mockingly
further, towards the darkening
center of the Bowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I say&#8211;I say, you fellows, that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
no stunt to pull off!&#8221; roared the nickum
wrathfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m due at the dance now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not coming to the dance.
There&#8217;s a girl here who doesn&#8217;t want
you!&#8221; rang back the voice of callow chivalry
in the barbarous pipe of the tenderfoot.</p>

<p>And Pem, slipping up from the grass,
her hands to her burning cheeks&#8211;for
she had not meant it to go as far as this&#8211;stole
back to the piazza, to dance away
from the shamefaced ecstasy of reprisal
in her heart.</p>

<p>Perhaps she would have felt that this
was too sore a snub to inflict for any
rudeness on Jack at a Pinch; perhaps
she would have compelled her boy-knights
to put out in the camp skiff and return
those oars&#8211;under pain of not dancing
with them, at all&#8211;had she seen the
illuminated column over which the victim&#8217;s
nose had been so disastrously bent.</p>

<p>It was in every sense a highly colored
description of her father&#8217;s record-breaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
invention, dwelling particularly, though
vaguely, upon the experiments so soon
to take place with a lesser Thunder Bird,
a smaller rocket, from the remote and
misty top of old Mount Greylock.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>A Record Flight</span></span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>It</span> had come at last, that starless night,
that stupendous night of which Pemrose
had dreamed for a year, as she perched
on a laboratory stool and watched her
father at work, when the little Thunder
Bird, the smaller rocket, would take its
experimenting flight, its preliminary canter,
up a couple of hundred miles, or so, into
the air,&#8211;and on into thin space.</p>

<p>Most dashing explorer ever was,
it would keep a diary, or log, of its flying
trip.</p>

<p>But whereas travelers, hitherto, had
carried that up a sleeve or in a breast-pocket,
it would have its journal in its
cone-shaped head; the little openwork
box, five inches square, with the tape-like
paper winding from one to another
of the wheels within and the tiny pencil
making shorthand markings, curve or dash,
as the air pressed upon it, until it got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
beyond the air-belt altogether&#8211;out into
that bitter void of space, where pressure
there was none.</p>

<p>No wonder that the inventor called this
log the golden egg, for when the magic
Bird had flown its furthest, when all the
little powder-rockets which, exploding
successively, sent it on its way, were spent,
then its dying scream would release the
log from its bursting head.</p>

<p>Back that would come, fluttering to
earth on the wing of a sable parachute,
lit on the way, as it drifted down two
hundred miles, or so, by the glowworm
gleam of a tiny electric battery,&#8211;a little
dry cell attached to it!</p>

<p>And this, really, was, as Pemrose had
said, the kernel of the present experiment
to her father, the only witness to
prove that the baby Thunder Bird had,
indeed, &#8220;got there&#8221;, flown higher than
anything earthly had ever ventured before;
and that if a little two-footer in
the shape of a sky-rocket had done so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
much, then there was nothing to prevent
a twenty-foot steel Bird from flying on
indefinitely,&#8211;even to Mammy Moon,
herself, or fiery-eyed Mars, perhaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that Dad has slept for
two nights now, thinking about its safe
return,&#8221; said Pemrose to Una, as in the
starless, breeze-tickled night the two
crouched together upon the mountain-top.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! that little firefly, the tiny electric
lamp&#8211;the &#8216;wee bit battery&#8217;, as Andrew
calls it&#8211;will guide us to finding
it when it drifts down,&#8221; panted the other
girl, excitement fixing that little peculiar
stand, like a golden lamp, in her dark
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&#8211;&#8221; perhaps her dream in
the bungalow of Ta-te, the tempest, was
affecting Pemrose&#8211;&#8220;but suppose, oh!
suppose, that the wind&#8211;there is a wind&#8211;should
waft it away&#8211;away from us,
down the mountainside, to where we
couldn&#8217;t find it in the woods&#8211;dark
woods&#8211;to where somebody, some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
horrid meddler, might pick it up, and get a
look at the Thunder Bird&#8217;s diary before
us ... the first record from so high up.
Oh&#8211;dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s sigh was echoed by that
stealthy wind around her, in whose every
whisper there was menace, as it swept
through the long grasses and ruffled the
ash trees of Greylock&#8217;s summit.</p>

<p>Una, to whom this &#8220;half the battle&#8221;,
the quick locating of the parachute and
its treasure, was not so vital, soared above
all threat in this witching-time of excitement&#8211;the
transcendent hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Thunder Bird&#8217;s diary! Oh-h!
the Thunder Bird&#8217;s diary,&#8221; she repeated
dreamily, as if reciting a charm.</p>

<p>Being Camp Fire Girls of fervid imagination,
the supreme invention, the beginning
of old Earth&#8217;s reaching out to the
heavenly bodies, gained its crowning
romance from them.</p>

<p>As moment by moment flew by romance
in their young breasts became a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
sort of rhapsody that set every thought
to wild music.</p>

<p>To Pem it was as she had dreamed it
would be, away back in her father&#8217;s laboratory,
before the February train wreck.</p>

<p>Hands seemed reaching out to her from
everywhere,&#8211;she the satellite reflecting
her father&#8217;s light.</p>

<p>From the four quarters of the habitable
earth eyes seemed trained upon her, as
she knelt in a little island of flashlight,
with her thumb on an electric button
which, connected by wires with a platform
about a hundred feet away, would
throw the switch and release the magic
Bird to flying.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-now, keep cool, Pem! Don&#8217;t get
excited&#8211;too ex-ci-ted&#8211;or-r you may
miss the moment when they shout to you:
&#8216;R-ready! Shoot!&#8217;&#8221; breathed Una, so
wrought up herself that her words had a
sort of little zip, a hiss, in them, like the
soft sighing of the breeze at the moment.</p>

<p>Pemrose knew that her father&#8217;s thoughts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
were taken up all the time with that summit
breeze, on how far it might affect the
safe return of the golden egg, as he hovered
about the low platform, a hundred feet
away, on which the little Thunder Bird
was mounted, together with his young
assistant tightening up every bolt and
screw for the record flight. A third tall
figure hovered near, within the ring of
distant flashlight, that of Una&#8217;s father, as
transported now over the whole experiment
as if he had never hinted that the
far-flying rocket was a Quaker gun.</p>

<p>With the girls in their little fairy-like
ring of electric light&#8211;to go out like a
will o&#8217; the wisp presently&#8211;was their
usual body-guard, old Andrew, who had
driven the party up the mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannily noo, lassie! <i>Cannily.</i> Dinna
be fechless&#8211;flighty!&#8221; The Scot was
breathing like a Highland gust as he cautioned
the girl whose tingling little thumb
touched lightly as thistledown the fairy
button. &#8220;Whoop!&#8221; he grunted sharply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
&#8220;I reckon they&#8217;re maist ready, noo, to
gie it its fling&#8211;let it go!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this moment that in the distant
island of flashlight an arm was flung up. It
was that of the professor&#8217;s young assistant.</p>

<p>He forgot to bring it down again.</p>

<p>And, lo! a hush, as of a world suspended,
fell upon old Greylock,&#8211;that
grim, black mountain-top.</p>

<p>The long grasses ceased to whisper.
The mountain-ash trees cuddled their little
pale berry-babies in awe.</p>

<p>&#8220;All R-ready! <i>Shoot!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Toandoah&#8217;s battle-cry it was.</p>

<p>A roar as of a small brass cannon, the
first gun of the new conquest, responded,
as the hand of a Camp Fire Girl of America
pressed the button, triumphantly throwing
the switch in the nozzle, or tailpart, of the
mounted rocket, a hundred feet away.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the flashlights went out.</p>

<p>And in the darkness&#8211;into the blackness
the little Thunder Bird soared.</p>

<p>Soared with the wild red eye of its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
headlight challenging the heavens themselves
to stop it, with its comet-like tail
of red fire streaming out full twenty feet
behind it.</p>

<p>At lightning speed,&#8211;fifty miles the first
minute, a hundred the next,&#8211;it leaped from
its mountain platform straight up&#8211;bound
for the vacant lot of space.</p>

<p>Explosion after bright explosion tore
the cloud-banks as, one by one, the innumerable
little rockets, which Pem had
watched her father fitting into their
grooves in its interior&#8211;far back in that
quiet laboratory&#8211;went off.</p>

<p>And with each radiant roar higher&#8211;faster&#8211;it
dashed, the little Thunder Bird,
with never a puff of smoke to dim the
spectacle&#8211;the transplendency of its
flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Michty! Michty!... <i>Magerful!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>There was just the one skirl from Andrew,
to lend it music on its upward way;
he had not thought that he came to
America to witness a thing like this.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>&#8220;Magerful&#8221;, indeed! Magical, indeed!
The others were silent, swept away by
the magic of it&#8211;the greater, moon-storming
magic to come.</p>

<p>Only&#8211;only, they breathlessly asked
themselves: &#8220;What next?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well! the immediate &#8220;next&#8221; would be
the return of the golden egg, the diary,
the falling fruit of the experiment, without
which there was no proof of its success&#8211;of
how high the fiery Bird had
flown&#8211;before, its last automatic charge
expended, it sang its swan-song somewhere
in space.</p>

<p>At the increasing speed with which
the little Thunder Bird flew&#8211;when miles
were but a moment&#8211;the record might
be expected back in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Minutes&#8211;but they seemed a moon&#8217;s
age!</p>

<p>It was Una&#8211;Una&#8211;who saw it first:
the tiny speck of star-dust drifting down,
down among the woolly clouds&#8211;dark
as if the night had been shorn and its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
fleece hung out to dry&#8211;alighting here
and there, the little firefly, in other words
the atomy electric battery attached to
the precious record, trying so hard, with the
parachute&#8217;s aid, to find its way back to
earth from the lonely height it had reached.</p>

<p>Another quarter of a minute, and they
could trace the outline of the black silk
parachute, itself, a drifting crow with
their prize in its claws; that prize which
the inventor, at least, would have given
ten years of his life to grasp&#8211;if, grasping
it, he could see that the little pencil
had duly made its record markings&#8211;the
proof that his Thunder Bird had &#8220;got
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory halleluiah! it&#8217;s drifting down
right into our laps&#8211;into the old mountain&#8217;s
lap, rather! The wind won&#8217;t carry
it far, I bet! &#8217;Twill land within quarter
of a mile of us, anyhow,&#8221; shrieked the
professor&#8217;s young assistant, a college boy,
an athlete, who had led the quarter-mile
sprint on many a hard-won field, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
the racing honor of a school was at stake;
and he ran as never before to get the
better of the tricky gusts and seize the
parachute&#8211;faster, even, than the
nickum, that mysterious youth, had run,
when he saved the day for the mountain
team at baseball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoot mon! Dinna ye let it get away
frae ye into the dar-rk woods!&#8221; skirled
Andrew, equally excited, and filled with
awe of the raven parachute now springing,
like a great, black mushroom, out of
the night&#8211;and of the firefly which had
been up so high.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it is&#8211;it is drifting towards the
dark spruce woods&#8211;where we&#8217;ll have
hard work to find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the wild chase after the prize, Pemrose
made a good third, as she thus shouted
her fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;See&#8211;oh! see, it <i>is</i> landing,&#8221; she
cried again, &#8220;c-coming down&#8211;touching
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes! for one fleeting instant it did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
alight upon a mound, the shooting starlet,
the little electric dry cell, winking
brilliantly against the background of
somber evergreens, now dark as Erebus,
that girdle old Greylock&#8217;s crown.</p>

<p>Then, freakish firefly, there, it was off
again, the prey of the nickum gusts, before
ever a hand could touch it&#8211;the
black parachute rotating like a whirligig.</p>

<p>Never&#8211;oh, never&#8211;was such a chase
for such a prize since mountain was mountain
and man was man!</p>

<p>Once again the steely clog, the weight
of the five-inch box containing the recording
apparatus, the precious log, almost
dragged it to a standstill! But the summit
gusts were strong.</p>

<p>Even the college boy began to have
heart-quakes and Pemrose heart-sinkings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove! What a stunt you&#8217;re pulling
off on us, you old black crow of a
parachute&#8211;you booby-headed umbrella!&#8221;
groaned he. &#8220;C-can&#8217;t you stay put for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
just a second? Or are you bent on leading
us a dance through the woods?&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to lose hope of its landing
in his lap, that breezy athlete, as it made
straight for the jaws of darkness now, the
inky spruce-belt&#8211;the parachute coquetting
with its pursuers, like a great black fan.</p>

<p>Was&#8211;was it the wind then?</p>

<p>Something&#8211;something caught it up, the
golden log&#8211;the first record from space&#8211;something
snatched it up and whisked
it off, off into those blackamoor woods,
while the feet of the foremost runner were
still many yards away.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas na the wind! &#8217;Twas mon or
deil; I saw it loop out frae the boggart
trees!&#8221; roared Andrew.</p>

<p>And now in his skirl there was a wild
ring of superstition that turned girlish
hearts quite cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw it loup out frae the dark&#8211;dar-rk
woods!&#8221; he insisted hoarsely.</p>

<p>Ah! but those dim spruce woods were
faintly illumined now with strange little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
dots and dashes of light&#8211;the firefly
winking passionately, as if somebody, some
thief, were running with it.</p>

<p>And <i>they</i> ran, too, its rightful owners,
in full cry, calling frantically upon the
robber, whether thief, or tempest, to stop.</p>

<p>And the girls kept bravely up with
the men. Or one of them did! For all
the spice of her chowchow name was
afire in Pemrose Lorry now; and she
would have tackled the thief, single-handed,
to get back her father&#8217;s record.</p>

<p>Into the core of darkness&#8211;in among the
ebony spruce-boughs&#8211;the jetty, frowning
trunks, the snarling, brambly underbrush,
dashed the chase, the hue and cry, not
daring to turn on a flashlight and in its
glare lose the one little piloting blink
ahead, which now seemed to have considerable
odds on them, as it fled helter-skelter
through the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;My word! this&#8211;this beats anything
I ever dr-reamed of,&#8221; gurgled the college
boy. &#8220;The Thing, whatever it is, has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
us nicely fooled. There&#8211;there, it has
switched off the &#8216;glim&#8217; now&#8211;the little,
telltale battery. Now&#8211;where are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one could tell, as they floundered
about, three men, and two girls, in the
mysterious night-woods&#8211;without a clew&#8211;Pemrose
clinging desolately to her
father now, Una to hers&#8211;while Andrew,
the Church Elder, muttered weird Highland
curses.</p>

<p>Nobody could tell where they were,
indeed, figuratively, of course, except&#8211;except
that the experiment was a failure,
so far as any proof to the World was concerned!</p>

<p>Except that Toandoah&#8217;s hopes were
dashed,&#8211;if not broken!</p>

<p>The first record from Space was stolen,&#8211;or
lost.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>The Search</span></span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>No!</span> She did not think the nickum
had taken it,&#8211;that mysterious Jack at
a Pinch!</p>

<p>This is what the bleeding heart of Pemrose
told her over and over again within
the next twenty-four hours,&#8211;and after
that, too!</p>

<p>True, she had robbed him of his oars
and a dance,&#8211;or had been responsible for
the trick!</p>

<p>She had not made her scout-knights
return those ashen blades until the morning
after the dance, when they were
surreptitiously deposited upon the opposite
shore of the lake in the neighborhood of
the camp near the insects&#8217; egg-boats.</p>

<p>And she had enjoyed herself hugely
as the guest of the White Birch Group
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
at the wind-up of the June carnival, while
he, twice a rescuer, a friend in a pinch,
was drifting helplessly out upon the dark
night-waters of the Bowl, trying to paddle
with his hands, within hearing of the
festive dance music, until some good Samaritan
from his own shore rowed out and
gave him a homeward tow.</p>

<p>But all this, as the girl passionately
told herself, was an everyday trick,&#8211;just
a paper pellet thrown at one beside
the overwhelming blow of the loss of her
father&#8217;s record.</p>

<p>And he who could quote Shakespeare
upon &#8220;Something rotten in the state of
Denmark&#8221;, amid the horrors of a zero
train-wreck, who &#8220;liked his excitement
warm&#8221;, had a sense of humor.</p>

<p>True humor is never without a sense
of proportion.</p>

<p>It knows where to stop.</p>

<p>But if the nickum was not the thief,&#8211;who
then?</p>

<p>Ta-te, the tempest&#8211;otherwise the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
mountain gusts&#8211;had to be acquitted
too.</p>

<p>For at the first dawn after the blighted
experiment some thin silk rags of a raven
parachute were found clinging, soot-like,
to bushes in the spruce wood, together
with a portion of a twisted and bent wire
frame.</p>

<p>There was not a trace of the diary, the
golden egg, the little perforated steel box,
with the recording pencil and paper in
it. Deprived of its wing, that could not
have gone on alone,&#8211;without some hand
carrying it.</p>

<p>So the weary and despondent searchers
were forced to accept Andrew&#8217;s assertion
that &#8220;mon or deil&#8221; had robbed them;
and it was plain from the solemn shake
of the &#8220;true-penny&#8217;s&#8221; gray head in its
up-to-date chauffeur&#8217;s cap that he, himself,
was disposed to lay the blame on a
&#8220;deev.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain to me, noo, that this auld
Earth should bide where she belangs,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
he told the two girls, &#8220;not go outside
o&#8217; her ain bit atmosphere&#8211;be sending
muckle messages outside it&#8211;it&#8217;s na
canny.&#8221;</p>

<p>He even respectfully delivered himself
of this opinion to the inventor&#8211;to Toandoah,
with the hungry look of loss in his
eye, which occasionally wrought Pemrose
to the point of choking sobs and to clenching
her fists at the mysterious robber.</p>

<p>And he repeated it, with elaborations,
did Andrew, on the second June morning
after the loss when Professor Lorry, declaring
that it would take a year to search
every foot of Greylock Peak, and that
he was not going to waste time in crying
over spilt milk, went down the mountain
with his young assistant and Mr. Grosvenor,
who had business in the valley,
to procure materials for another experiment&#8211;although
not on the same scale
as the first&#8211;the girls being left behind
with the landlady of the little mountain
inn where they were staying.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>The chauffeur wore a &#8220;dour&#8221; look as
he saw them depart, Una&#8217;s father driving
his own car; for the first time in all
his well-trained service, the true-penny
was inclined to sulk over being told to
keep an eye on two &#8220;daft lassies&#8221;, who
refused to go down to the town, because
they wanted to search some more&#8211;or
Pemrose did.</p>

<p>So he sat on a bench outside the little
mountain house, thirty-six hundred feet
above sea-level, where there were no
visitors at this early season, with the exception
of the experimenting party, and,
between whiffs of his pipe, discoursed
upon the folly of simple earth folk in
&#8220;ganging beyant themselves, thinking o&#8217;
clacking wi&#8217; the Man in the Moon, forbye&#8221;&#8211;and,
in tones seemingly bewitched,
of the black shape he had seen
jump forth from the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! I do believe you think that
it was some bad fairy, Andrew,&#8211;fairy
or mountain &#8216;deev&#8217;, who stole the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
record, and part of the parachute, too&#8211;spirited
them away,&#8221; said Una, with
fanciful relish, having not quite grown
beyond the fairy-tale age, herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s so, girlie,&#8221; said the mountain
landlady&#8211;alas! for Andrew True-penny,
alias Campbell, now came the
evil chance over which he sulked&#8211;&#8220;if
that&#8217;s so, and you could only find the
mountain wishing-stone, stand on it and
wish three times&#8211;wish har-rd&#8211;maybe,
the good fairies would give you back what
you&#8217;re looking for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8211;where is it&#8211;the wishing-stone?&#8221;
The little fixed star in Una&#8217;s
eye was never so bright&#8211;a twinkling
star of portent. &#8220;The wishing stone on
Greylock! Oh! I never knew there <i>was</i> one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Havers, woman! Dinna ye ken that
ye hae a tongue to hold?&#8221; muttered the
grizzled chauffeur, in a stern aside.</p>

<p>But the motherly New Englander&#8211;who,
with her old husband, could not for
a moment be suspected of the theft&#8211;had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
her heart full for two sorrowing girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! it&#8217;s a little over a mile from
here, I guess, down the Man Killer trail,
the third flat slab you come to. I&#8217;d
go with you myself&#8211;though it&#8217;s rough
traveling, the steepest trail on the mountain&#8211;only
my man is laid up with the
rheumatiz, hangin&#8217; on to him like a puppy-dog
to a root.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! we can find it for ourselves&#8211;hurrah!&#8221;
shouted Una, almost squinting
with anticipation. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never stood upon
a real mountain wishing-stone before.
Who&#8211;who knows what may come of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>In her young blood, as in Andrew&#8217;s,
was the extravagant excitement of the
whole experiment,&#8211;this first step in the
ladder of demonstration which was by
and by to reach the moon&#8211;lending to
all an unearthly touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;The&#8211;the Man Killer trail! Why!
that&#8217;s <i>one</i> place where we haven&#8217;t
searched&#8211;yet!&#8221; A moping Pemrose
suddenly awoke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>To her, who had grown up amid the
mathematical realities of an inventor&#8217;s
laboratory, who had &#8220;plugged&#8221; so hard
at her elementary physics that she might
be able to grasp the first principles of her
father&#8217;s work, some day&#8211;some day to
work with him,&#8211;to her, the little girl-mechanic,
a wishing stone was no golden
magnet.</p>

<p>But the very fact that there was one
spot, not so far from the summit, either&#8211;wildest
spot on the mountain though it
be&#8211;still unexplored, was enough to draw
her restless feet anywhere, against any
deadlock of difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! The Man Killer trail!&#8221; she
whooped again. &#8220;Oh-h! we could easily
find it; we saw a sign directing to it, as
we came up the mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s na a trail; it&#8217;s just a hotch-potch
o&#8217; rocks&#8211;some sharp as stickit
teeth!&#8221; groaned Andrew, who saw his
own doom fixed, in vain protesting.</p>

<p>He felt rather like a man who had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
left behind to hold a wolf by the ears
when, in the teeth of every remonstrance
he could offer, he found himself, a little
later, starting out in the rear of two adventurous
girls, in quest of that third slab
of a wishing stone&#8211;and the breath-racking
Man Killer trail.</p>

<p>But those girls were, to some degree,
seasoned climbers, both,&#8211;sure-footed as
venturesome!</p>

<p>Through the dim limelight of fringing
pine woods, across oozing mud-beds, soft
from spring rains and freshets, over a
babbling brook spanned by an elastic
bridge formed of the interlacing roots
of giant trees&#8211;where Una found much
delight in bouncing up and down in anticipation
of the magic stone&#8211;they stubbornly
held their way, and came at last
to the chaos of rocks crowding a steep
gorge which marked the head of the
lonely Killer trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noo&#8211;I gang first!&#8221; said Andrew&#8211;a
true-penny still, though the stamp was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
reversed. &#8220;My word!&#8221; he added sourly,
&#8220;this is na trail&#8211;juist a scratch on the
mountainside&#8211;an&#8217; the muckle rocks
they&#8217;re a flail for beating the breath out
of a puir body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;what do I care if they
shouldn&#8217;t leave me a pinch if only I could
find something&#8211;even a few more rags of
the parachute!&#8221; gasped Pemrose, in stifled
tones of passion, as she climbed, hurry-skurry,
over a piled capsheaf of bowlders.</p>

<p>Indeed, that battling breath was at a
low ebb in all three when, following the
tangled skein of a sort of trail which the
feet of daring climbers had beaten, here
and there, amid the rocks, they reached
in due time the third slab which, like
the invisible running water in Tory Cave,
was supposed to bring &#8220;piping times&#8221;
of luck to whoever should brave the difficulties
of the wild pass, to stand on it
and wish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;oh! there it is, at last,&#8221; cried
Una, her hand to her breathless side, &#8220;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
nice &#8216;squatty&#8217; slab&#8211;almost as smooth
as glass&#8211;an&#8217; shaped like a mud-turtle.
I wonder if there is a fairy underneath
it&#8211;lurking under the rim. Now&#8211;now
for the wishing cap!&#8221;</p>

<p>But before she could don Fortunatus&#8217;
cap by breaking a wee branch from a
dwarf cedar growing amid the crags and
wreathing it, like a green cottage bonnet,
around her head, she slipped upon the
wet moss girdling the stone where a tiny
spring bubbled, and almost pitched headlong
down the trail, at this point particularly
steep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy there, lassie! Ye dinna want to
mak&#8217; o&#8217; that auld flat slab a tombstone,
eh?&#8221; murmured Andrew, laying a great
hand upon her shoulder, with a little
smack of laughter upon his long, smooth-shaven
upper lip.</p>

<p>But immediately he winced as if his
own words hurt him, and Pemrose&#8211;herself
in an aching mood&#8211;knew what he
was thinking of, that grizzled chauffeur.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>Una, her balance recovered, jumped
upon the stone.</p>

<p>Surely, no wishing-cap ever before was
so bonnie, so becoming as the fine,
emerald needles of the little cedar branch
gripped together under the dimpled chin,
fringing the sweet, saucy, girlish face, the
star in the bright dark eye so intently
fixed.</p>

<p>Pem smiled; in the present crisis of
her young life she didn&#8217;t care if her friend&#8217;s
eyelashes were longer than hers by a whole
ell. And Andrew sighed because of that
one &#8220;sair memory&#8221; which had oppressed
him on the Pinnacle.</p>

<p>The serio-comic passion in the green-framed
face, the fervor in the one little
clenched fist drooping at Una&#8217;s side, might
well have won over all the good fairy-hosts
that ever landed in the wake of the Pilgrims,
and set them to scouring Greylock
for the missing record from on high.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then! Pemrose, it&#8217;s up to you!
Turn your backbone into a wishbone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>The wreathed figure stepped from the
pedestal,&#8211;a laughing June spot against
the wintry grimness of the Man Killer
trail.</p>

<p>Obligingly the inventor&#8217;s daughter
stepped up, closing her eyes half-humorously,
doubling the drooping hands
at her panting sides.</p>

<p>But, as suddenly, the eyelids were flung
up, like shutters from the blue of day.
The uncurling fists were outflung passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t! I <i>can&#8217;t</i>!&#8221; cried Pemrose
Lorry, choking upon her own wishbone.
&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;m not in the humor for it&#8211;for
foolery! I must go on&#8211;right on&#8211;and
search! This&#8211;this is the shortest trail
down the mountain, if it&#8217;s the roughest&#8211;I
know that!&#8221; She looked desperately
at old Andrew. &#8220;If any mean
thief&#8211;anybody&#8211;stole that record,
there could be only one&#8211;one motive
for it, my father-r says&#8211;curiosity; to be
the fir-rst to see that very first record man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
has ever got from so high up&#8211;high up
in the earth&#8217;s thin atmosphere, where
the air ends&#8211;and space begins!&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed to have that whole zero
void in her heart now, its light, stifling
gases in her distended throat&#8211;Toandoah&#8217;s
little pal&#8211;as she looked distractedly
down the gorge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s pos-si-ble&#8211;just barely
possible, that after he had satisfied his
cur-ios-ity&#8211;or mischief&#8211;or whatever
it was&#8211;he might have thrown away
the little steel box, dropped it somewhere
on the trail,&#8221; she panted extravagantly.
&#8220;Or&#8211;or we might even come
on some more rags of the parachute and
track him&#8211;track him to a camp! My
father-r&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the passionate break on that
word, even more than the spice in the
blue eyes, that went straight to the shadowed
spot in Andrew&#8217;s heart and found the
little sprig of memorial heather, hidden there,
the mountain heather, the tiny, pinkish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
blossoms, with the faint, wild tang, which
he plucked whenever he went home to
Scotland from a small grave in a hillside
&#8220;kirkyard&#8221; on whose granite marker
was printed: &#8220;Margery Campbell, aged
fifteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been as much the restlessness of
bereavement as a desire to better their
fortunes which had brought his wife and
him to the New World, for she had been
their only child, with the exception of
one son, old enough to be in the American
Army.</p>

<p>The fragrance of that imaginary heather-bloom
tucked away in the impassive
chauffeur&#8217;s breast was occasionally
apparent in a furtive glance thrown skyward,
or in a momentary glisten of mist
in the gray shell of the mechanical eye.</p>

<p>It had made the whole family of his
employers very sympathetic towards
Andrew, as to a friend. And now a whiff
of that heather memory stood Pemrose
in good stead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>&#8220;I reckon if leetle Margery were livin&#8217;,
she&#8217;d feel in the verra same way gin
anny misfortune happed to me,&#8221; he told
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, weel, lassie!&#8221; Thus he spoke
aloud. &#8220;Since ye&#8217;re set on gaeing on a
wee bit further, we&#8217;ll gang; but dinna
get yer hopes stickit on finding onything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Andrew&#8211;Andrew, himself, has found
something! Look&#8211;look at him!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was barely twenty minutes later that
the wildly startled cry burst from Una
as the trio struggled on&#8211;on down the
fitful path, between the rocky jaws of
the Man Killer, where beetling crags
loomed, fang-like, on either side of them
and, here and there some swollen rill
made of a green moss-bank a slimy mud-bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8211;he&#8217;s hearing things, if he isn&#8217;t
seeing them. Oh, look!... Look at
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Una&#8217;s hand was at her jumping heart&#8211;pressing
hard as if to hold it in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
body&#8211;as she beheld the tall figure of
the chauffeur, motionless as arrested
mechanism, upon the trail, ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heerd a&#8211;skirl.&#8221; Andrew&#8217;s face was
stony as that of the Old Man of Greylock&#8211;a
featured rock&#8211;as he turned
it upon the breathless girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;A skirl! A cry!&#8221; he repeated hoarsely.
&#8220;&#8217;Twas na the yap of an animal, either!
Somebody&#8211;somebody&#8217;s yawping for help
out here in this awfu&#8217; spot! Dinna ye hear
it, children?&#8221;</p>

<p>They did. Their flesh began to creep.</p>

<p>Up, upward, struggling between great
rocks, it climbed, that cry, where the
stony teeth of the Man Killer bit the trail
right in two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help&#8211;h-help!&#8221; it pleaded. &#8220;Oh&#8211;help!&#8221;
Then feebly, but fierily: &#8220;<i>Oh-h!</i>
confound it&#8211;<i>help</i>, I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the moment when Pemrose
Lorry shook as if the old Man Killer were
devouring her.</p>

<p>Was there&#8211;could there be something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
familiar, half-familiar, about the faint,
volcanic shout: some accent she seemed to
have heard before? And yet&#8211;and yet,
not quite that, either!</p>

<p>&#8220;My word! Some puir body&#8217;s hur-rted
bad&#8211;ba-ad&#8211;like a toad under a harrow,&#8221;
grunted Andrew, and scrambled hastily on
over a gray barrier of rocks,&#8211;the girls
following.</p>

<p>Once again it limped painfully up to
them, the cry, like a visible, broken thing.
&#8220;Help&#8211;h-help, I say!&#8221; Then, feebly,
in rock-bitten echo: &#8220;<i>Help!</i>&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>The Man Killer</span></span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>We</span> must lift him out of the mud!
Oh-h! even if it hurts him&#8211;terribly&#8211;we&#8217;ll
have to lift him to a dry spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Pemrose Lorry who spoke. Together
with her Camp Fire sisters she
had taken some training in first aid. And
one agonizing accident which she had been
told how to deal with was the case of a
knee-cap displaced or broken.</p>

<p>There almost seemed to be a broken
head on her own young shoulders through
which wild, streaky lights and shadows
came stealing, like moonlight through
cracked shutters whose chinks are not
wide enough to reveal clearly any object
in a room.</p>

<p>It was the same breathlessly unreal
feeling&#8211;the same dim moonlit groping,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
that she had felt as she sat on the cliff-brow
with Stud, when he talked of the
nickum and his father&#8211;and called the
latter a &#8220;queer fish!&#8221;</p>

<p>For one thing she knew at a glance!
She had seen the injured man, who lay
calling for help in a miry spot of the Man
Killer trail, before. Three times before,
said lightning perception!</p>

<p>And it came upon her now, as emergency&#8217;s
stiff breeze blew the cobwebs from her brain,
the occasion of the second time, sandwiched
in between that zero day when he had
dragged her up a snow-bank, the youth
who saved her addressing him as Dad, and
the smiling June one when he lay on a fernbed
before his lake-shore camp, grumpily
fishing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I saw him: I know I saw him&#8211;again&#8211;crossing
the street outside
Una&#8217;s home on the day when the last
installment of the Will was read,&#8221; she
realized, her hands coming together convulsively
at the thought of the blighting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
codicil which hung up the fortunes of the
moon-going Thunder Bird for twelve long
years.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8211;he was wearing the same gray
cap!&#8221; was the next cleaving flash of
memory.</p>

<p>He was not really wearing it now. It
bobbed in the rill beside him.</p>

<p>As one eye turned feverishly towards
it, the third thunder clap of perception
came in the staggering sense of how like
he was to Una.</p>

<p>She might have been his daughter&#8211;Una&#8211;with
that little fixed star of feeling
set like a shining pebble now in her
right, fascinated eye, reflected, exaggerated
in the glazed cast of pain in the stone-gray
eye of the man beneath her, whose
climber&#8217;s suit of homespun was daubed
with mountain mud,&#8211;whose tweed cap
was the brooklet&#8217;s toy.</p>

<p>He had been trying to scoop up water
in it.</p>

<p>And that brought Pemrose Lorry, Camp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
Fire Girl, to herself again, within quarter
of a minute of her first laying eyes on him.</p>

<p>For there is one gallant anchor that
will hold in any pinch,&#8211;when thought
is shattered and speculation the maddest
blur: the Camp Fire law: Give Service!</p>

<p>She unhooked her little camper&#8217;s cup
from where it hung at her green belt, and
offered him a drink.</p>

<p>She dipped her handkerchief in the
trickle of water and wiped the cold drops
of faintness and agony from his forehead.</p>

<p>And then, when he had confided to
Andrew, who knelt beside him, that he
had slipped upon the wet, slimy moss
beside the rill, as he ascended the trail,
and broken his knee-cap by striking
heavily against a confronting rock, she
said that they must lift him to a dry spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8211;r-right. She knows what
to&#8211;do. Ouch! a&#8211;a knee-cap slipped,
or broken&#8211;is&#8211;the deuce of a rack,&#8221;
groaned the victim, as they proceeded to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
raise him, the girls supporting, each, a
knickerbockered leg, Pemrose the injured
one, while Andrew took the main weight
of the writhing body, until they laid it
upon some dry moss.</p>

<p>Yes! and she knew further what to
do, that Camp Fire Girl who wore the
Fire Maker&#8217;s bracelet upon her wrist,
for plucking off her soft, green sweater
she rolled it into a wad and placed it
under the hollow of the injured knee, so
flexing it, supporting it, while Una
doubled hers into a pillow for his head,&#8211;Una
who moved as if in a fantastic dream.</p>

<p>And then arose the question as to the
next move; how to go about obtaining
further help.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might&#8211;might make a stretcher
with poles, saplings, with our sweaters,
your coat, Andrew, and&#8211;and carry him
down to the nearest farmhouse,&#8221; Pem
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o thank&#8211;you!&#8221; The injured
man shifted his shoulders ever so slightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
upon one elbow and looked at her; the
tiniest laugh shot the rapids of pain in
his eye. &#8220;My son said you had a whole
lot of &#8216;pep&#8217;&#8211;same that&#8217;s in your inventor-father,
I suppose, who wants to
bombard the moon!... My son who&#8217;s
play-ing baseball now down on the Greylock
field&#8211;mountain&#8217;s foot!&#8221; The
sufferer here appealed to Andrew. &#8220;If
you could&#8211;only&#8211;get him up here, I&#8217;d
be all right! There&#8217;s an auto at the nearest
farmhouse&#8211;maybe they&#8217;d let you take
it. Any one&#8211;any one can point out
&#8216;Starry&#8217;&#8221;&#8211;in a lame rush of pride&#8211;&#8220;player
who made that home run&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadna I better bid him bring a doctor
along too&#8211;a stretcher as weel?&#8221; put
in the Scotchman dryly.</p>

<p>The victim nodded, looking at the
other&#8217;s cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a chauffeur,&#8221; he pleaded;
&#8220;you&#8217;ll drive fast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, fegs! Fast as God and gasoline
will let me!&#8221; answered Andrew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
devoutly, with an anxious glance at the
two girls.</p>

<p>As his tall, spare figure scrambled on
down the trail, the sufferer raised his
eyes to Pemrose.</p>

<p>&#8220;If&#8211;if you could t-twist my knapsack
round from under me,&#8221; he murmured;
&#8220;there&#8217;s a restorative in it&#8211;a
few drops of ammonia&#8211;I&#8217;m faint!&#8221;</p>

<p>She did so&#8211;and turned for the moment
as faint as he was.</p>

<p>The whole trail swam, grew black&#8211;black
as the wisp of thin, ebony silk,
parachute silk, with a fraction of a bent
wire frame peeping out from one corner
of that roomy knapsack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! are you going to desert me
now-ow?... Now that the thief is so-o
nice-ly bagged!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked up at her, some dash
of whimsical fire in him mastering weakness;
at the girl kneeling, bolt upright,
with the black rag between her hands,
and the twisted scrap of frame,&#8211;the
frame which had drifted down two hundred
miles.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>&#8220;Ar-re you&#8211;going&#8211;to desert me
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the anchor held; the noble
anchor: Give Service: it was as if a voice
outside of her numbed self spoke the
words.</p>

<p>The raven rags dropped from between
her fingers,&#8211;their reflection from her face.</p>

<p>Steadily enough, she found the little
vial lying amid the top layer in that
pigskin knapsack, shook a few drops from
it, into the thimble-like glass accompanying,
mixed them with water, held them
to his lips.</p>

<p>At the same time she dipped her handkerchief
again and passed it over his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Pity as well as &#8216;pep&#8217; in you,
eh? Good!&#8221; The sufferer actually
winked one eye as the stimulant trickled
down. &#8220;Well! my dear, the little recording
apparatus is in that knapsack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
too; I&#8211;I make you a present of it&#8211;and
of the codicil to my brother&#8217;s will,
as well.... You won&#8217;t have to wait
twelve years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, indeed, the trail seemed to double
up, to wind itself around Pem&#8217;s brain,
rocks and all,&#8211;only every rock was gold-edged,
a nugget.</p>

<p>Her eyes stared straight before her,&#8211;blue
as the June violet that caught a drop
from the spring near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8211;who are you?&#8221; screamed Una,
forgetting that she was speaking to a
broken man.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about my being your uncle, Treffrey
Graham, my dear, who&#8211;who was
such a mad fellow&#8211;in&#8211;youth; s-such an
oddity? Oh-h! you&#8217;ve heard of him&#8211;have&#8211;you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The whimsical light in the pain-reddened
eyes burned to mockery now.
It showed the hippogriff, the &#8220;hot tamale&#8221;,
still there. Evidently eccentricity wasn&#8217;t
all dead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>&#8220;Humph! By Jove! I&#8217;m having
some fun out of my broken knee, after
all&#8211;electrifying you girls,&#8221; gurgled the
still racked voice. &#8220;Dramatic setting for
a denouement, too, the old Man Killer
trail!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why&#8211;oh! why-y did you do it?&#8221;
Pem snatched up the rag of parachute
again, her eyes going wildly from the
soot-like scrap of silk to a wonderful,
antique ring upon the little finger of the
pale hand which twitched so strangely
below her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! S-steal the little record, you
mean!&#8221; The bushy eyebrows were
twitching, too. &#8220;Well! maybe I want-ed
to make sure, for myself, that the rocket
really had gone higher than anything
earthly ever flew yet, before&#8211;before I
resigned a fortune to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the moment when the nuggets
all turned to rocks again for Pemrose.
He saw the change in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t mean anything der-og-a-tory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
to your father, my dear&#8221;&#8211;pain
snatched at the man&#8217;s breath&#8211;&#8220;or to his
invention, either. I knew him before you
did. &#8216;Why did I do it?&#8217; Curiosity&#8211;eccentricity,
I suppose&#8211;anything you
like to call it! I always was such a
&#8216;terror&#8217;&#8211;a regular zany, my college
friends used to call me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flash from those prankful days, erratic
as a shooting star, shot the glaze in the
sufferer&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, then&#8211;and then, I really am
interested in everything connected with
the conquest of the air&#8211;of space&#8211;myself,&#8221;
the hampered speaker went on.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done a little flying, out West,&#8211;my
son, too! I found out when the
experiments with your father&#8217;s in-vention&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We call it the Thunder Bird,&#8221; put
in Una, as pain again called for a break.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Good name for it! Piles up
the moon-going romance, eh? Well-ll,&#8221;
wearily, &#8220;having found out the par-ti-cu-lar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
night on which the lit-tle model
rocket was to fly, I came up the mountain
to a small camp that my son and I
have ne-ar the summit&#8211;east side of
Greylock. I was standing on the edge
of the spruce woods, watching the whole
performance. Then&#8211;then, when the
parachute dragging the little recording
apparatus blew towards me in the darkness,
almost into my hand, I&#8211;why!
I snatched it up and ran with it. Why?
Oh, because I suppose the boy has never
died in me: the boy that&#8217;s &#8216;part pirate,
part pig!&#8217;&#8221; with a grating chuckle.</p>

<p>Incredible as it seemed, the low laughter,
the treacherous tinkle, was echoed by
girlish lips as that renascent urchin momentarily
swaggered in the glaze of the
suffering eye!</p>

<p>&#8220;And then&#8211;and then something told
me&#8211;an aberration, I suppose, as my
impulses usually are&#8211;that I had some
sort of r-right to see the very first record
man had ever got of that upper air, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
Space, if&#8211;if I was go-ing to turn over
a couple of hundred thousand dollars, for
the pursuit of the&#8211;sov-er-eign invention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I can&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; murmured Pem
into the stony teeth of the Man Killer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to return the record next
morning, but I was a-fraid your father
might shoot me,&#8221; to Pemrose. &#8220;Then,
later, I heard he had gone down the mountain&#8211;that
was yesterday and a mistake&#8211;I
went-down, too, to beard him. A&#8211;a
little more water, please! I could
not climb again until to-day; I took the
Man Killer trail, as being the shortest.
And&#8211;here I am!&#8221; grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Incidentally, I gave our family lawyer
a shock, little niece,&#8221; he went on, as Una,
plucking up courage, adjusted her sweater
under his head; she began to like this uncle
with the pebble-like cast in his stone-gray
eye, she began to think that girls&#8211;Camp
Fire Girls, especially, with their love of the
fanciful&#8211;might have more patience with
him than others had had.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>&#8220;Yes! you bet I gave old Cartwright
the staggers!&#8221; He laughed down the
twinge of agony in his voice. &#8220;Called
him up on the long distance telephone,
told him I was Treffrey Graham back;
that I had been in the East nearly six
months, with my son; that I came pretty
near disclosing myself on the&#8211;on the day
when the third installment of my brother&#8217;s
will was read&#8211;actually walked up to
the door of my sister&#8217;s house, then shied
off, because ... Oh, gosh! this knee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice broke; it had really become
a feverish babble of excitement now&#8211;pain&#8217;s
wild excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! What was I saying&#8211;yes! I
didn&#8217;t ring the bell because I hadn&#8217;t made
up my mind whether I wanted to claim
any share of my brother&#8217;s fortune, or not;
you see he hadn&#8217;t been very fair to me
in youth&#8211;taking away my sweetheart.
None of my family had&#8211;for&#8211;that&#8211;matter!
I didn&#8217;t know whether I wanted
to meet them again. Although I liked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
look of my little niece; I had seen her, at
a distance, with her mother. And then, we
didn&#8217;t need the money, my boy and I!
Had enough of our own; Treffrey Graham
may be a terror, but he isn&#8217;t a failure&#8211;financially!&#8221;</p>

<p>No&#8211;not by a long shot! said the
flame of the pigeon-blood ruby upon the
pale little finger, now curling significantly
in air,&#8211;the gem whose fire in this wild
spot seemed as erratic as his own, seeing
that none but a zany would have worn
it here.</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8211;so I told old Cartwright this
morning that I stepped out of that strung-out
will,&#8221; a smile curled the pallid lips
now; &#8220;that I authorized him to make
preparations, at once, for the turning
over of the remainder of my brother&#8217;s
wealth, in his name and mine, to the
University of our native city, to be used
for the furtherance of Professor Lorry&#8217;s
won-der-ful invention for r-reaching in-de-finite
heights.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>&#8220;My father!... Oh! my fa-ther!&#8221;
It was a wild little cry to which the Man
Killer rang now, as the head of Pemrose
Lorry went down upon her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m glad his way is clear&#8211;though,
I suppose, only a man &#8216;whose head
grew under his arm&#8217; would have managed
the thing as I have done.&#8221; The sufferer
winked through the veil of pain. &#8220;Now!
my son is different. He&#8217;s a dare-devil
too&#8211;but he knows where to stop. You
couldn&#8217;t have bribed him to steal that record&#8211;though
somebody played a trick on him
the other night&#8211;robbed him of his oars
and a dance&#8211;just when he had &#8216;taken the
bit between his teeth&#8217;, too; said he was
tired of this camouflage business, and he was
going&#8211;going whether I liked it, or not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ah-h!</i>&#8221; That was the moment when
Pem&#8217;s shoulders trembled like the needles
upon the little green cedar sapling that
grew by the rill: all because the Wise
Woman in her was shaking the Elf, bidding
her go to sleep for ever&#8211;which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
the Elf, very properly, refused to do,
for, after all, undiluted wisdom would
be a colorless cloak for any young back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! he&#8211;he wouldn&#8217;t speak to us
when we just wanted to thank him for
saving us in that terrible train-accident,&#8221;
put in Una defensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! That was my fault, little niece.
I made him promise, on coming East,
that he wouldn&#8217;t go near any of his relatives,
risk being identified by them, until
I had decided what to do about the legacy&#8211;and
whether I was going to make myself
known to them, or not. Now-ow, I
hope you&#8217;ll be friends. He&#8217;s your own
cousin&#8211;Treff junior.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Jack at a Pinch at last came
into his own in the shape of a name!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, called after me, he is! Goodness!
don&#8217;t I wish he&#8217;d hurry up and
get here, now&#8211;with the doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a hollow groan. Pain was, at
length, getting the better of that capricious
spirit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t&#8211;can&#8217;t I do&#8211;anything&#8211;to
make you more comfortable?&#8221; Pemrose
asked.</p>

<p>Then suddenly remembering that it was
he who was making the Thunder Bird&#8217;s
fortune, as impulsively as the little cedar
tree leaned to the swollen rill, she bent
and kissed the cold sweat of pain from
his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8211;that&#8217;s worth coming East for,&#8221;
murmured the man, his own eyes growing
wet. &#8220;Little niece! don&#8217;t you want to&#8211;follow&#8211;suit?
I suppose, a year from now,
your Thunder Bird will fly.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>A June Woman</span></span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>I feel</span> as if I was in the pictures!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I feel as if I was in the pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the wild thought in each girl&#8217;s
breast, as minutes went on.</p>

<p>The loneliness of the mountain pass,
nearly three thousand feet above sea-level,
the rigors of the wind sweeping up
it, chill now, June not yet being ten days
old, the frowning crags, the remote heads
of other tall mountains peeping over their
shoulders, the two green dots of girls on
either side of a broken man, they took
it all in, to the full, most dramatically
too&#8211;and felt as if they were in the pictures.</p>

<p>A surpassing moving picture reel, more
telling than any they had ever witnessed,
in which&#8211;oh, queer double-headed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
feeling&#8211;they were both actors and spectators!</p>

<p>But pain&#8211;pain left no atmosphere of
unreality about it for the suffering man,
for the sufferer who monopolized both
their soft sweaters, while they shivered
convulsively, until if it came to a beauty
contest between the two now, the old Man
Killer, awarding the palm, would not have
made it dependent on a mere matter of
eyelashes, but on which little nose was the
least blue bitten.</p>

<p>Pain released something in that sufferer
too,&#8211;a fire that was not all wild-fire!
For suddenly he dragged Una&#8217;s green
sweater-roll from under his head and
thrust it towards her with an imperious:
&#8220;Put it on, child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t!&#8221; replied that child of luxury,
as arbitrarily, slipping it back under
the pallid cheek, above which the stand
of agony in the stony eye told that the
man was suffering almost to a point of
delirium now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>&#8220;Who ever thought Una would be such
a brick?&#8221; Pem nibbled the words between
her chattering teeth. &#8220;She&#8217;s shivering&#8211;yes!
and frightened and trying to cry&#8211;but
the brick in her won&#8217;t allow it!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the uncle of
her blood was a brick, too, for he fought
the groans reverberating behind his
clenched teeth, like a bee in a bottle,
only breaking out now and again in a
yearning prayer for the coming of his
son.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he were only here&#8211;here!&#8221; he
moaned; it was evident that the youthful
daredevil who liked excitement, but
&#8220;knew where to stop&#8221;, was a tower of
strength to the less balanced father.</p>

<p>Pem was longing uncontrollably for his
appearance, also&#8211;for the rower whom she
had robbed of his oars, while the sufferer
seemed to find his only relief in talking
about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son and I have been in bad scrapes
before among&#8211;mountains,&#8221; he panted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
feverishly. &#8220;Once high up in the
Canadian Rockies, we missed our guide
who had gone back for provisions. Bad
plight then, but the boy didn&#8217;t &#8216;cave&#8217;!
He was only fifteen when he shot his
bear in Arizona. He loves the West.
But the East&#8217;s in his blood. Just went
wild over these Berkshire Hills, this spring,
over his first sight of mayflowers! They
seemed more of a treasure than the fortune
he wanted to part with. <i>Hiff-f!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the eyes of both girls rose the
clamor of color &#8220;blooming round&#8221; in old
Tory Cave&#8211;the armful of passÃ« blossoms
flung down at the &#8220;rattler&#8221; scare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;his Mother Earth has been
good to him,&#8221; muttered the whimsical
voice. &#8220;Very good! Yet&#8211;yet such are
earth-sons that he&#8217;d turn his back on
her to-morrow&#8211;go off on a wild-goose
chase after some other world&#8211;even a
dead one&#8211;if only that moon-storming
Thunder&#8211;Bird&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! You don&#8217;t mean to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
say&#8211;oh! did he write to my father about it&#8211;write
to my father and sign himself
&#8216;T. S.&#8217;?&#8221; broke in Pemrose, glancing back
along the trail which she had traveled
these past few months and finding it
stranger, more baffling than the Man
Killer&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;May&#8211;may&#8211;have done so,&#8221; came
the answer, with a faint chuckle. &#8220;I asked
him when pressed for a name to give his
mother&#8217;s&#8211;his middle one&#8211;Selkirk. But
he a lunar can-di-date! Not if I know it!
With me, the moon may have the money&#8211;but
not the boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The moon may have the money!&#8221;
Pemrose Lorry glanced at the mud-stained
knapsack lying by the sufferer,&#8211;the
knapsack tucked away in which was the
golden egg, the precious record; she
would not unearth it and glance at it,
because the second look, at least, belonged
to her father.</p>

<p>This mature madcap upon the ground,
this queer, practical joker, chastened now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
if never before, had played on him a cruel
prank, but, at least, he was not the fool
who loved money for its own sake.</p>

<p>&#8220;If&#8211;only&#8211;I could do anything for
him!&#8221; yearned the girl passionately.
&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;d want father&#8211;father&#8211;to
feel that I did ev-ery-thing for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, as once before in a watery pinch,
the thought of Toandoah&#8217;s honor, Toandoah&#8217;s
debt to this trapped March hare,
was the vital breath of inspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have&#8211;have you any matches?&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly she bent to the ashen ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my br-reast pocket, yes.&#8221; It was
a feebly appreciative flicker.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fire! I&#8211;I a Camp Fire Girl&#8211;and
not to think of it sooner! Una!
Una! Get busy! Gather wood, quickly&#8211;quickly&#8211;all-ll
the dry wood you can!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the friendly little cedar gave of
its one brown arm, the spruce chit, the
birch stripling, the pine urchin&#8211;all the
hop-o&#8217;-my-thumb timber that flourished
in this wild pass&#8211;contributed of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
dead limbs torn from them by last winter&#8217;s
blasts, to burn up the chill in the old
Man Killer&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>Una&#8217;s little nose, piquantly tiptilted,
warmed from a fashionable orchid-color
to a cheery rose pink, with the excitement,
the pressing adventure of trailing
firewood among the rocks and dragging
it captive to the new-born blaze which
Pem was fanning with her breath and with
the breezy bellows of her short green skirt.</p>

<p>As for the sufferer, hope stirred anew
in him as he turned his head towards the
flaming pennons of good cheer, while the
fire, prospering gayly, feathered its nest
with scarlet down.</p>

<p>He saw, too, that the fire-witch was preparing
something in that red nest for him.</p>

<p>Raking out the first glowing embers,
she filled her little aluminum cup at the
rill and set it among them; when it
steamed she shook into it a few drops
from the little vial&#8211;the aromatic spirits
of ammonia&#8211;and held it to his lips.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best I can do,&#8221; she murmured,
but her eyes stretched that best
into an indefinite blue of longing to capture
the pain even for a short time and
bear it for him&#8211;for him who was making
the Thunder Bird&#8217;s fortune.</p>

<p>As before, the stimulant set the racked
heart to sending strength through the freezing
veins&#8211;and with it a touch of the whimsicality
which Death alone could quench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little girl!&#8221; Treffrey Graham&#8217;s eye
winked upon a mote of fun that softened
to a mist. &#8220;Your fa-ther&#8217;s invention is
the gr-reatest thing yet; it&#8217;s a Success&#8211;I
know that from the one glimpse I
had at the record&#8211;&#8221; Pemrose winced&#8211;&#8220;but&#8211;but
you may tell him from me
that I doubt if, after all, his Thunder
Bird is the best thing he&#8217;s turned out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some-somebody coming! Oh-h, some-body&#8211;coming!&#8221;
cried Una, at that
moment, so that the man started up,
with a heyday exclamation&#8211;and tumbled
back, a wreck of groans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>For it was not his son. Neither was
it the long-coated figure of the chauffeur,
at sight of which each girl would have
passionately hugged herself&#8211;if not him.</p>

<p>But it was a messenger whom Andrew
had sent.</p>

<p>And at sight of her, of the fresh mountain
rose in her cheeks, with its heart of
American gold, the climbing flash in her
hazel eye, Una just tumbled into sobs,
herself, that little fixed star in her eye
blazing pathetic welcome, for this was
her first taste of emergency&#8217;s pinch, emergency&#8217;s
call for sacrifice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you&#8211;oh! are you come to stay
with us&#8211;us?&#8221; she cried, running forward
with childish confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I be&#8211;girlie!&#8221; responded the
mountain woman, throwing a warm arm
around her. &#8220;The man that borrowed
our little aut&#8217;mobile truck and set off in
it at a score down the mountain, the man
with a queer blowpipe at the roots of his
tongue, he told me that he had left two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
lassies up here on the lonely trail, with
a badly hurt man. &#8216;Woman!&#8217; says he,
kind o&#8217; fierce-like, &#8216;if they were yer own
bit lassies, ye&#8217;d scorch the rocks, climbing
to &#8217;em.&#8217; &#8216;Man!&#8217; says I,&#8221; the Greylock
woman paused, half-laughingly, to catch
her breath, &#8220;&#8216;I never laid eyes on them,
or on the broken-kneed man, either, but
I&#8217;ll warm the way, just the same.&#8217; But,
mercy! it took me most an hour to get
here&#8211;though only a mile of climbing&#8211;the
old Man Killer is&#8211;so-o&#8211;fierce.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eye, at that, went to the fire, now
brilliantly painting the trail, to the
pillowed figure upon the moss, with the
sweater-roll in the hollow of the injured
knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, land sakes! I needn&#8217;t ha&#8217; been
in such a mad hurry getting here, after
all&#8211;giving my skin to make ear-laps
for the old Man Killer!&#8221; she cried, holding
up two raw palms, flayed by indiscriminate
climbing. &#8220;For, my senses! they&#8217;re
no stray lambs o&#8217; tenderfoot&#8211;those &#8216;twa bit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
lassies&#8217;!&#8221; mimicking Andrew&#8217;s blowpipe.
&#8220;They know how to take care of themselves
in a pinch&#8211;and of somebody else,
too!... And&#8211;and, see here, what
I&#8217;ve brought you, honey, rolled in the
blanket for <i>him</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cake&#8211;choc&#8217;late cake! C-coffee!&#8221;
Una gasped feebly, confronted by the
ghost of her everyday life.</p>

<p>She grasped the reality, though, of that
normal life, somewhere waiting for her,
with the first bite into the brown-eyed cake,
while her sweater was restored to her thinly
clad shoulders as the mountain woman
spread her blanket over the injured man
and tucked it under him for a pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;you&#8217;re a &#8216;trump,&#8217; little niece&#8211;letting
me have it for-r so long,&#8221; he said
wistfully.</p>

<p>And Una shyly forbore to answer.</p>

<p>Occasionally it is easier to land gracefully
after a long jump than a short one in
the case of an awkward gulf to be crossed!
She saw that her friend Pemrose, no relation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
at all to this extraordinary uncle, could
care for him and welcome him without
embarrassment, while, with every doubtful
glance in his direction, she felt, still,
as if she did not quite know whether she
was on her head or her heels.</p>

<p>She crept, for reassurance, very close
to the mountain woman, the typical June
woman, with the normal rose in her cheeks,
and the golden buttercup for a heart, as
she picnicked, subdued, by the trail fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think&#8211;oh! I don&#8217;t believe
I ever met anybody q-quite like you before.
But I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re in the
world!&#8221; she murmured gratefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I just wish you could come into
<i>my</i> world often, girlie,&#8221; was the cuddling
answer, &#8220;for it&#8217;s lonely as old Sarum
here on the mountainside&#8211;though where
old Sarum is I don&#8217;t know myself!&#8221;
breezily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I!&#8221; laughed Una.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Man Greylock doesn&#8217;t talk to
one, you know&#8211;only roars sometimes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
The woman lifted her eye to the dim
peak above her, with the pale mists
streaming, tress-like, about its crown,
from which Mount Greylock takes its
name; then her anxious glance returned
to the sufferer. &#8220;Ha! there he goes&#8211;making
faces at the pain again,&#8221; she
murmured pityingly. &#8220;And, mercy! I
suppose &#8217;twill be a blue moon yet&#8211;a dog&#8217;s
age&#8211;before his son can get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a long age anyhow; although,
in reality, little more than an hour&#8211;a
wild, wind-ridden, fire-painted hour&#8211;before
three haggard men came stumbling
up the trail.</p>

<p>Two carried a stretcher between them.
One had a bag in his hand.</p>

<p>As they hoisted that collapsible
stretcher between its poles over the last
bleak hurdle of rock, one, the youngest,
dropped his end of it, which the doctor,
shifting his bag, took up.</p>

<p>Jack at a Pinch rushed forward.</p>

<p>And ever afterwards Pem liked that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
churlish nickum because he ignored her
then; because he had no more consciousness
of her presence, or of Una&#8217;s, or of the
June woman&#8217;s, than if they had been rocks&#8211;blank
rocks&#8211;by the trail, as he flung
himself on his knees beside his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad! <i>Dad!</i>&#8221; he cried, his face as gray-blue
with hurry as his baseball flannels.
&#8220;Oh-h! Dad, what have you been doing
to yourself&#8211;now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The biter bitten&#8211;Treff! Joker
pinched!&#8221; came the answer in tones
almost jocular, for the love in that boyish
voice was a cordial. &#8220;Well! I guess
I haven&#8217;t got my death-blow now you&#8217;ve
come. And&#8211;and the murder is out,
boy: these little girls know all-ll: who
you are&#8211;who I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, indeed, Jack at a Pinch raised
his head and looked straight across into
the blue eyes of Pemrose Lorry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have thought me an awful
&#8216;chuff&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about the oars,&#8221; was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
mute reply of the girl&#8217;s eyes, but the least
little tincture of a smile trickling down
from her lip-corners, said: &#8220;But I&#8217;m
glad I got even with you, somehow!&#8221;</p>

<p>However, there was too much &#8220;getting
even&#8221; just now in this wild spot&#8211;Life
grimly settling accounts with the dragon
who had so often &#8220;hazed&#8221; others&#8211;for
the boy and girl to spend any more conscious
thoughts upon each other.</p>

<p>There was the terrible trip&#8211;the worst
mile ever traveled&#8211;down the Man
Killer trail, for him, strapped to the
stretcher, after the doctor had examined
the injury and found the delicate kneecap
both slipped and broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess if&#8211;if I pull through this, I&#8217;ll
be a&#8211;reformed&#8211;character; no more&#8211;no
more eccentricity for me,&#8221; he murmured
dizzily to Pemrose who, when the
trail permitted, walked beside him, stroking
his hand,&#8211;and he rolled his eyes
faintly, through the veil of the opiate
which the doctor had given, at the knapsack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
beside him, wherein lay the golden
egg.</p>

<p>And with his own hands, the Man Killer
at last conquered, as they laid him in an
ambulance, he took the five-inch, open-work
steel box, the precious record, from
that knapsack&#8217;s depth and handed it to
her.</p>

<p>She could not look at it, the little Thunder
Bird&#8217;s log of that two-hundred mile
trip aloft, she could only jealously clasp
it to her breast,&#8211;Toandoah&#8217;s little pal.</p>

<p>&#8220;T-tell your fa-ther from&#8211;me,&#8221; said
the broken voice, &#8220;that Treff Graham is
the same old Treff; that he m-may be
a pirate, but he isn&#8217;t a pig&#8211;not re-al-ly!
That,&#8221; faintly, &#8220;he apol-o-gizes&#8211;and
steps aside; that, with all his heart&#8211;it&#8217;s
there, if it is a madcap&#8211;&#8221; wanderingly,
winkingly, he touched his left breast&#8211;&#8220;he
hopes that, a year from now, the highways
of the hea-vens may be opened&#8211;the
im-mor-tal Thun-der Bird will fly!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>The Celestial Climax</span></span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>A year</span> from then it did!</p>

<p>It awoke the World with its challenging
roar, silencing for ever, let us hope,
the racket of guns upon this dear planet,
leading man in future to seek his conquests
in more transcendent ways, even
outside Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, as it took
its pioneer flight again from the misty
top of old Mount Greylock.</p>

<p>The World and his wife were there to
see: scientists from the four quarters
of the globe&#8211;Earth&#8217;s great ones.</p>

<p>And other spellbound spectators, too:
Una, the White Birch Group, their Boy
Scout comrades&#8211;Stud fast developing
into the type of hotspur who wanted
to take passage for the moon&#8211;all massed
in such a stupendous Get Together as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
made the mountain seem &#8220;moonshine
land&#8221;, indeed, to their thrill-shod feet.</p>

<p>And never&#8211;oh! never since the
history of Mother Earth and her satellite
began did such a spectacular traveler
start on such a flaming trip as when the
hand of a Camp Fire Girl of America
threw the switch and the steel explorer,
twenty feet long, leaped from its platform
high into the air, pointed directly
for the moon, with a great inventor&#8217;s
mathematical precision,&#8211;trailing its two-hundred-foot,
rosy trail of fire.</p>

<p>There was not breath&#8211;not breath,
even, to cry: &#8220;Watch it tear!&#8221;</p>

<p>Only breath enough, in young girls&#8217;
bodies, at least, to gaze off at Mammy
Moon, loved patron of many an outdoor
revel, and ponder upon the nature of the
shock she would get when the Thunder
Bird&#8217;s last explosion lit up her fair face
with a blue powder-flash&#8211;lit it up for
earth to see!</p>

<p>&#8220;Do&#8211;do you think &#8217;twill ev-er get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
there&#8211;two hundred and thirty thousand
miles, about, when&#8211;when an eighth
of an inch out at the start; and it would
m-miss&#8211;miss?&#8221; breathed a youth who
knelt by the heroine of the evening, the
inventor&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toandoah doesn&#8217;t miss. My father
doesn&#8217;t miss.&#8221; The young head of Pemrose
Lorry queened it in the darkness,
with a pride which made of old Greylock,
at that moment, the world&#8217;s throne.
&#8220;But how&#8211;how are we to live through
the next hundred hours&#8211;the next four
days&#8211;the time the Thunder Bird will
take to travel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet they did succeed in living through
it and in leading time a merry dance too,
for young Treffrey Graham, junior, all
old scores forgotten, was proving a prince
of chums, as spirited in play as he was
prompt in a pinch.</p>

<p>And together&#8211;hand clasped in hand,
indeed&#8211;by virtue of her being the inventor&#8217;s
daughter, he the son of the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
who had resigned a fortune to the transcendent
invention, side by side with two
or three of those Very Great Ones, they
stood, four nights later, looking through
a monster telescope upon a mountaintop,
and saw&#8211;saw the celestial climax,
the first of the heavenly bodies reached.</p>

<p>Saw the blue powder-flash light up the
full, round face of the Silver Queen they
loved, while the Thunder Bird, expiring,
dropped its bones upon her dead surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8211;got&#8211;there,&#8221; breathed the youth.
&#8220;What next? Some day&#8211;some day, maybe,
we&#8217;ll be shooting off there&#8211;together?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! if only the Man in the Moon
could shoot us back!&#8221; breathed Pemrose.</p>

<p>Already it had come to be &#8220;we&#8221; bound
up with &#8220;What next?&#8221; for it would,
indeed, be a zero &#8220;next&#8221; in which the
hands of youth and maiden would not
meet in comradeship&#8211;and love.</p>

<p>But the sun and center of the girl&#8217;s
heart was still&#8211;and would be for long&#8211;her
father.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>The greatest moment of that unprecedented
night came when Toandoah bent to
her, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Pem! there was just one moment
when I may have been discouraged,
you remember! None knew the Wise
Woman who saved the city.&#8221;</p>

<p class='c i fs08 mb20'>A story of the best type of home life, with a charming heroine.</p>

<p class='c sc fs16 mb20'>Then Came Caroline</p>

<p class='c'>By LELA HORN RICHARDS</p>

<p class='fs08 c'>With illustrations by M. L. Greer.</p>

<p class='fs08 c'>12mo.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cloth&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;306 pages.</p>

<hr class='hr20' />

<p>Caroline was the fourth daughter in Doctor Ravenel&#8217;s family
of five girls,&#8211;fourth on the list, but first in mischief, in ingenuity,
in originality, in human sympathy and democracy. The
father&#8217;s health made it necessary for the Ravenels to leave their
old Southern home and migrate to Colorado. Here Caroline
grew up&#8211;from ten to eighteen&#8211;her days full of interest,
her courage, as the family struggled along under straitened
circumstances, always unflagging. Sometimes the delight and
sometimes the despair of her mother and her sisters, Caroline
made friends in many quarters and met in unusual ways the many
emergencies into which her impulsiveness led her.</p>

<p>This is a splendid story of the best type of home life, and the
four other girls&#8211;Leigh the unselfish, Alison the ambitious and
self-seeking, Mayre the artistic and Hope the baby&#8211;complete
a well-individualized group, alternately caressed and disciplined
by old black &#8220;Mammy,&#8221; who had accompanied her &#8220;fam&#8217;bly&#8221;
from Virginia. There are plenty of boys in the story too, likable
lads, such as inevitably would gather around a group of wholesome
and merry girls, ready for a game, a dance or any other
frolic. Caroline will be a favorite with girl readers. They will
enjoy the account of her running away; her attempt to help her
mother form a &#8220;social acquaintance&#8221; in their new home; her outwitting
of Alison at the party; her early literary efforts; and the
daring with which she &#8220;puts her finger&#8221; in nearly everyone&#8217;s &#8220;pie.&#8221;</p>
